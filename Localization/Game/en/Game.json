Here’s your takeoff, your turn, your board toss, and... your wipeout.\" I swipe through the screen, showing Bai Mo each shot.\nSeeing a few embarrassing ones, Bai Mo panics and quickly snatches the camera from me, putting some distance between us. \"You've done great—some of these can definitely be deleted. Let me help you with that!\"\n\"Hold on, Bai Mo!\" I raise my hand, trying to stop him from leaving. But he's determined to protect his reputation as a guild leader, even covering one ear with his hand.\n\"There's a—\" Watermelon peel...\nToo late. Completely focused on evading the situation, Urbino's leader takes a slip on the watermelon peel, sending him flying in the busy beach crowd. This time, it wasn’t just the camera that caught the moment.",
    "6_EasterEggTip": "[The liveliness is theirs, and I’m not looking for it either.]\n\"Uh...\"\nThat woman, always so composed and unflappable, finally showed an expression I’d describe as 'speechless.'\nMeredith shifted her gaze, clutching the beach volleyball in her hands. \"I never expected a rare break for myself would mean running into an Urbino team-building event.\"\n\"I tried to pick a quiet time to come out and practice, but somehow I've become the subject of rumors about a beach ghost haunting the night...\"\n\nGalatea couldn't help herself and burst into laughter. In the next second, she saw the typically aloof scholar's ears turn slightly pink in embarrassment, hugging the volleyball and looking ready to make a quick escape.\n\"Alright, I'll stop laughing. Won't you stay and keep me company?\" Galatea quickly reached out to persuade her. \"I can join you for volleyball practice.\"\n\nMeredith flinched as a delicate hand touched hers, causing the volleyball to slip and bounce twice on the ground.\nLike a flamingo finding a kindred spirit on the shore, offering a feather in a gesture of friendship. \"Like you, the noise is all theirs—I’m not interested.\"\n\"Maybe we could be friends?\"",
    "5_EasterEggTip": "[The Butterfly's Watching]\nA gentle night breeze rustled by—nice and soothing, yet it sent a shiver through Michele, covering her in goosebumps. She thought she caught sight of a shadow on one of the poolside lounge chairs! \"Hey partner, did you feel the temperature just drop? And...someone's watching us... Ah-choo!\" Michele sneezed.\n\"Nope, didn't notice anything. Maybe you've been swimming too long and caught a chill. How about we head back and get some rest?\"\nWas it really nothing? Michele wrapped a towel around herself, casting a wary eye around. Just beyond her line of sight, a purple butterfly fluttered gracefully, making a few loops around the poolside bar before settling on an open mission report, its pages still blank.",
    "3_EasterEggTip": "[Stress Relief Toy]\n\"I'm really sorry! It won't happen again!\" Bai Mo clasped his hands together, apologizing to both Chiyo and me. Celestia sighed deeply, \"Mr. Bai, I've reminded you countless times—please consider the time and place before making your grand entrances.\"\n\"Don't worry about it, it's not a big deal.\" Despite her evident disappointment, Chiyo managed a polite smile.\n\"Haha, well, even if the pictures were a bust, you still clinched the championship!\" Bai Mo tried to lighten the mood.\nUh-oh! I sensed an awkward shift in the atmosphere—Bai Mo had an uncanny knack for mentioning the wrong things at the wrong time!\nAs expected, even though Chiyo kept smiling, a vein started twitching at her temple. \"Mr. Bai, I feel I must correct your—huh...?\"\nShe paused, surprised as I pressed a small rubber duck into her hand. The duck was soft and plump, with a belly and cheeks that puffed out humorously when squeezed.\n\"What’s this?\"\n\"It's a stress squishy,\" I whispered. \"If you feel mad, just give it a squeeze! I promise I'll snap the perfect photo when it's time for your award.\"",

But just then, a seagull swooped in with an eerie chuckle, and before she knew it, lifted her into the sky!\nI rubbed my eyes. Was I seeing things in the middle of the day?\n\"Navigator, I'm really flying!\" Leona's excited voice echoed from above. I looked up to see nothing but a distant speck fading into the sky.",

The marked spot showed that the hit was perfectly centered, without an inch of deviation.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'm all ears.\"\nEven for a fun water gun game, Chiyo prepared with dedication, snatching every spare moment 30 minutes before the contest to practice.\n\"I have nothing to add, truly.\" I praised her wholeheartedly: \"In fact, I’d say the outcome of the match is already decided.\"\nA gentle blush crept onto Chiyo's cheeks as she grinned softly. \"I heard our Navigator is in charge of taking photos and keeping records.

I quickly raised my camera and gave her an \"OK\" sign, prompting her to offer a slight smile before turning her focus back, slowly raising her water gun.\n\nChiyo squinted her eyes! She was about to squeeze the trigger! The decisive moment of triumph was just about to—\n\n\"Look who it is! Been a while, hasn't it?\"\n\nA powerful force suddenly hit me from behind, propelling me forward. An arm draped over my shoulder, accompanied by a familiar voice calling out warmly.

Camera in hand, I wander along the shoreline, seeking my next photo target: Leona. The waves crash, the crowd roars, and the sea of jet ski racers draws nearer. Among the mix of familiar and unfamiliar faces, I'm looking for a determined, vibrant young woman.\n\n\"Heads up—move aside!\"\n\nWith the roar of the engine, the sea's surface is sliced open by a trail of silver, and amidst the cry of gulls, Leona surges like a dolphin through the water, riding the crest of the waves. In the sunlight, her streamlined suit highlights her athletic physique, her skin shimmering like scattered diamonds. Confident and bold, Leona is truly a sight to behold! I quickly raise my camera and capture this stunning moment.\n\n\"Ah, here's our champion!\" I said after the race, spotting Leona wrapped in a quick-dry towel at the rest pavilion. \"Wanna see your highlight reel?\"\n\"Did you capture the part where I overtook everyone?\" Leona's eyes lit up, instinctively leaning in before pausing. \"Oh, wait! My hair's still dripping...\"\n\nTiny droplets formed along her jawline, collecting at the tip of her sharp chin.

Did you catch that?\" He springs up, seamlessly transitioning into a half-squat, balancing perfectly on the center of the board.\n\"Yeah, yeah, I'm getting it.\" I snap another photo, though my tone can't hide my growing disinterest.\n\"Finally, stand firm! Ride the waves! Look awesome!\" He strikes a side-standing pose, arms wide, finishing with a cool surfer stance and flashes me a peace sign.\nThe whole surfing sequence takes place entirely on the shore. I've taken dozens of photos, and not a single drop of water on him.\n\"After all that posing, are you ever going to hit the water?\" Unable to hold back any longer, I decide to go on strike.\n\"Hey, take it easy! Just wanted to capture the whole flow, you know how I roll. I'm the best free runner there is! Surfing's gotta be a breeze.\" Under the weight of my stare, Bai Mo lets out a sheepish laugh, grabs the board, and runs toward the ocean. \"I'm heading in! Keep the camera rolling!\"\n\nAlthough Bai Mo talks big, his surfing skills are genuinely impressive. He maneuvers through the rolling waves with a commanding presence, so much so that I almost imagine he's got his own epic background music... Wait, is that actually music?\n\nI lower the camera and squint to focus. Bai Mo really does have a mini speaker hooked to his waist, pumping out booming music. As he rides closer, the music swells to ear-splitting volumes; when he drifts away, both he and the tune fade into the background—it's surreal, to say the least!\n\n\"Yeah, it’s that guy with the green hair, the one out there surfing!\"\n\"We've had a bunch of complaints about him disturbing the peace. If we don’t nab him soon, us beach patrol folks will be a laughing stock!\"\n\nThings are heating up... I glance at the security team converging onshore and back to Bai Mo, still riding the surf.

The club spared no expense organizing this, ensuring guests leave both satisfied and invigorated by their holiday experience.\n\nIt's nine o'clock, and the poolside is completely deserted. Normally, it'd be buzzing with life at this hour, perfect for gathering a few friends for a chat and a drink on the lounge chairs. But, after a day of racing, I suppose everyone's tuckered out. Having finished tallying today's race results with Celestia, I'm finally off duty. Heading out, I purposely choose the path that circles the pool, craving the crisp night air.\n\nHold on—out of the corner of my eye, did that giant inflatable swan in the middle of the pool just twitch? Am I imagining things?\n\nI quickly turn to face it, locking eyes with the innocent swan. It's just floating there, untouched, not even a ripple in the water around it. Crossing my arms, I stand at the pool's edge, determined to stare holes into that goofy swan's head.\n\nOne minute, two minutes, five... The swan begins to rock subtly at first, then more noticeably, until a stream of bubbles erupts from its base. Holding back laughter, I maintain my stern gaze, intent on seeing this through.\n\n\"Blub blub... splat—I give up, I surrender!\" Michele emerges from the water, stars practically spinning around her head, waving an imaginary white flag as she clings to her float. \"Partner, with eyes like yours, you're wasting your talent if you’re not playing FPS games...\"\n\"I recognized it was your wiggling tail right away,\" I crouch by the pool and point to the guilty culprit flapping about. \"Didn't see you all day, and you sneak out at night for a swim? What's your plan?\"\n\n\"Can't escape your eagle eye, it seems,\" Michele laughs sheepishly. \"I got special permission from Captain Flavia for this trip, so I could join on official business. I'm supposed to be Leona and Chiyo's bodyguard! But let’s be real, they don’t need my protection. Honestly, it's more like not getting in their way is the best help I can offer!\"\n\"Daytime's too sunny, so it's perfect for gaming indoors. At night, there's no sun, which makes it ideal for stretching and moving around. Hey, you won't rat me out to the captain, will you, partner?\"\n\nWell, that logic's pretty solid, leaving me at a loss for words. I just raise my thumb in silent approval.

What do you think, Navigator?”\nThe lone figure keeps their distance, holding their saxophone.\n“...I wouldn't feel very comfortable being so close, but if you feel it will help you conduct, I won't voice any complaints.”\nLawine speaks calmly, maintaining a mysterious profile in the sunset.\nA calming and nostalgic étude is played once more.\nOne can't help but be confident that the performance will be one that lingers in the memory.",
    "3_Content": "“Bai Mo suddenly dumped this task on me. I'm really a little... uh... unconfident.”\nIn the practice room, Maddelena looks at me with a violin in her hand. Through her glasses, I can see a lost look on her pale and youthful face.\n“I really... uhm... what if my sister sees? Eh...? Just let you guide me? Treat it as a paintbrush...?”\nInstead of replying, I simply raise my baton and start conducting with the score. Maddelena makes a lot of harsh and pained sounds, and it takes till dark for us to get the atmosphere right.\n“Can you feel it, Navigator? In this way, even someone ordinary like me can keep up with someone like Bai Mo...!”\nShe's got it the wrong way around. The ordinary timbre is the most important part of any performance. Without the violin's thread, the entire performance may as well be empty talk.\nMaddelena's shy smile gives off the airs of a reserved calmness that is hers alone. With it, one can't help but be intoxicated by the sound of the music...",
    "4_Content": "Outside the practice room, I hear the sound of piano movements slowly flowing out from a crack in the door.\nEven after I open the door, the girl remains focused. Her light, slender fingers dance along the black and white keys, continuing until they strike the last note on a black.\n“Music is fascinating. It's so different from medicine and anything else I've dabbled in. It's so easy to get drawn in without even noticing.”\nAs she speaks, she lifts the little hat on her head and shoots me a playful wink.\n“Want to try piano four hands? You won't be able to conduct properly without giving it a go.”\nBefore I can react, Kokona pulls me to her side.\n“Don't worry, just follow my lead.”\nOur melody steadily blooms into a cheerful dance of keys.\nKokona might be right. If you spend all your time on the podium, you lose sight of the full picture.\n“I'm looking forward to the performance. If we could continue playing together in the future... I think I'd like that.”\nThere's a hint of caring expectation in her smile...",

    "2_Content": "When I arrived at the practice room, I found Bai Mo already perched in a chair, hard at work on his études, glancing at me through the corner of his eye.\n“What do you think, friend? A good pitch, is it not?”\nI must admit that Bai Mo is quite the accomplished musician. Knowing his unreliable nature, it's hard to imagine he could be as elegant and gentle as he is now.\n“Come and conduct. Let's have a proper practice performance.”\nI raise my baton and extend an invitation for him to begin.\n“Alright! Check this out!”\nThe tuba becomes spirited, moving in lockstep with the conductor's baton and leading the rhythm - most fitting for Bai Mo, indeed.\n“Capital, my friend! But now is not the time to trade compliments. There is still much work to be done.”\nThe corners of his mouth are raised in expectation. It seems that he has all the faith in the world that I'll make this a success.",

It is for this reason I especially wanted to pass this letter to you...\n“There's no time, my friend. Only you can help me now! Only you can put these weirdos... Ahem, I mean, only you can get everyone on the same page to make this performance a success. I'm counting on you!”\n                                               - Bai Mo",

As a competent member of the Phantom Thieves, I adjusted my time of arrival based on the situation to ensure the item would be unveiled on time.”\n\n- Why did you plan a bomb? I don't get it.\n     - “Because I wanted something fun! Besides, I had to blow up the surveillance devices and the secret passage.

Celestia contemplated how to respond.\nChildren can't grasp the complexities of Collapse Syndrome, but they can see its effects. Someone close to them might suddenly change, becoming argumentative and causing endless quarrels and tension within their family - a once-happy home now shattered.\nFaced with the child's pain, Celestia felt that any reassurance would be powerless to ease his wounds.\nShe knew his parents were alive, but afflicted by Collapse Syndrome, they were like strangers. What would become of the children left behind? What future awaited them?\nCelestia was determined to soothe the minds of the young ones in her care. As she watched them sleep, she imagined healing their deep mental scars, bit by bit.\nUrbino's funding resolved her financial concerns, but Celestia still lacked dependable partners, leaving her to shoulder more work. Early mornings and late nights became routine. To stay alert, she created a drink she dubbed Starlight Coffee—a bittersweet, refreshing brew that became a small daily joy.\nThe Astral Sanctuary gradually earned a reputation. Those who experienced her care would never forget Celestia. Yet, she remained alone.\nAt least, until the Navigator entered her life...\nPerhaps Celestia, regarded as a \"star\" by her patients, will finally receive a \"star\" of her own?",

He had a wide field of vision. His small size meant he could squeeze through gaps and navigate difficult terrain. The most suitable task would be...\n“Arrrrgh! I've got nothing!!” Kokona scratched her head in distress as she paced through campus.\nAttention drawn by the ruckus, a girl slightly younger than Kokona popped her head around the corner. “Excuse me - is there something bothering you?”\nPerhaps she just needed someone to vent to. Kokona wasn't expecting much. Nevertheless, she painstakingly repeated the story of her assignment and Mister Sea Bunny's past and present life.\n“If that's the case, why don't you just ask him? If he could choose, what would Mister Sea Bunny like to do?”\nBefore she could say anything else, the girl was quickly called away by an older woman bearing the uniform of a PUS executive.\nKokona can still clearly recall the brilliant starry pattern on that girl's dress, along with her carefree advice.",

Their adversaries seized the moment, called for a re-election, and mercilessly ousted the father-daughter pair.\nThis betrayal solidified Audrey's resolve, deepening her distrust of anyone outside her immediate family.\nDetermined to safeguard the remnants of their business, she announced the company’s delisting and vigorously explored new ventures.\nWhile outsiders might see the Grove legacy fading, Audrey knows that a true Grove never bows easily.

Despite the solitude, Yvette enjoyed this life: it was quiet and undisturbed, allowing her to dive deep into complex studies, dreaming of one day becoming one of those experts working at the data terminal.\nShe assumed this peaceful routine would continue forever until one morning when she woke to an unsettling silence at home. No voices, no footsteps, no breathing...\nYvette never considered herself particularly intuitive, but she stubbornly believed that the overwhelming certainty she felt at that moment was the strongest proof of her bond with her parents. She didn’t need to wait or ask anyone to confirm it; she only had to notice the vanished research manuals from the bookshelf to realize the truth—her parents had left, without her.\nYvette had never minded the cold.

Impressive, but I'll need to hear more.”\n“What if I told you I put him back together? Check it out! Doesn't he look more like a sea bunny now?”\n“Hm. Not bad for a student. But there's a fatal flaw.”\nFaced with Kokona's blank expression, the admissions officer let out a sigh.\n“Listen carefully. What you have now is just an empty shell with a cute face. Kokona, machines should also have their own souls.”\nKokona let out a slight frown of dejection. She had never thought about this.\nThe admissions officer was right.

Every time Kokona was about to open a gift, she would make a guess and comment on what she received during the next video call. It was the special little ritual of her family.\nKokona would have never been able to guess what she received this time - a round, barrel-shaped housekeeping bot.\nThough she'd seen all manner of strange antiques and artifacts, this was the first time Kokona had come into contact with such advanced technology.\nBoasting a simple design, powerful, cutting-edge materials, and the power of AI, these bots gave Kokona an entirely new sense of wonder.\nWhen she pressed the power button, the sensor on the top of the bot would spin around like a pair of rabbit ears.\n“Mister Robot, are you a rabbit? What's up with the pair of long ears?”\n“Correction. The 'antennas' on this device are biosensors designed to imitate those on sea bunnies.”\n“So... You're not a rabbit?

As the patriarch’s daughter in the esteemed Grove family, she was groomed to uphold elegance and nobility, never to yield easily. Her childhood was meticulously crafted by her strict parents, filled with over ten daily lessons—from equestrianism to finance, negotiation, music, and dance.\nAudrey's rarefied talent enabled her to master these fields at a pace unmatched by her peers. What others might find a burden—the honor and duty of the Grove name—she saw as a beacon of potential. Alone with the family emblem in her hand, she dreamt of radiating such noble brilliance.\nDriven by willfulness or perhaps a daughter's heartfelt wish, Audrey cherished musical tea gatherings with her family.

Yes, and there's Fay, too. Fay is family...\"\nWith a sigh, the woman finally turned away.\nYvette sat on the sofa holding her teddy bear, and once the visitor left, her world returned to silence. Absentmindedly stroking Fay's ear, her mind began to wander: Fay was the first gift from her mother, who never gave her anything. What was her mother thinking when she handed Fay to her? Was she feeling guilty, helpless, or perhaps relieved to finally let go of a burden?\nHer hand paused as she felt something odd on Fay's ear—a seam had come undone...\nA small tear had formed where Fay's ear attached to its body, as if Fay was hurt too.\nHer vision blurred with tears that fell in drops, as if hoping to mend the toy bear's wound.\n\"It's okay, Fay...\" Yvette said, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. \"Yvette will fix you, give you a body that won't get hurt...\"\n\"Fay, please don't leave Yvette again...\"",

Cloudscape Gallery was hardly a challenge for her skills.\nAs a result of her post, Maddelena was once again exposed to the media of the art world and, inevitably, her sister's continued stardom.\n\"If only I could shine so brightly...\"\nWith a hint of defiance, Maddelena looked down on Kaleidoscope palette, imagining it was filled with her own vivid colors...",

    "10703_StoryContent": "Maddelena developed a habit of laughing off everything at school, no matter the nicknames or gossip.\nRedoubling her efforts in her studies, she was able to barely maintain above-average grades.\nAs Maddelena's graduation project neared, many of her proposals were rejected by her instructors. Seeking help, she sought out Galatea, who had already graduated.\nMaddelena showed Galatea sister over thirty carefully designed sketches with the genuine hope that her sister would be able to understand and appreciate her designs.\nBut all she got was a cold response,\n“These designs shouldn't count as art at all.”\nGalatea was always straight to the point. Her words weren't intended to sting, but how could they not?\nMaddelena immediately asked if she could see Galatea's designs. When she was given a bunch of scraggly lines and circles with no clear meaning (some sketches were even blank!), she only grew more confused.\n“Do you mean... that these count as art?”\n“Then what should? Those sketches of yours that no one gives a second look? Do you have any idea how many Dream Tokens the auction house has valued these at?”\n“Sister, art can't be measured in Dream Tokens...”\n“You're still as naive as ever. You've stayed curled up in your cage like a bird without wings - that's why no one's opening their doors to you!”\nThe atmosphere grew tense enough to cut with a knife. The sisters continued to bicker until their parents finally intervened.\nMaddelena has long forgotten how their fight ended.\nShe and Galatea returned to their old equilibrium. Galatea would show her beautiful hats while she would express exasperation at Galatea's strange designs.\nBut ever since that fight, Maddelena found that her sister spent far less time at home. Galatea would often disappear or drop out of contact without so much as a warning.\nShe had no idea where Galatea would go, but she could tell something had changed. An invisible barrier was standing between Maddelena, Galatea, and their family.",

As the responsible agency, P.U.S attached great importance to the reports and promptly assigned personnel to assist.\nBut these efforts bore few results. As the medical community was still locked in debate, the outbreak of The Collapse began.\nAs a member of P.U.S, Celestia had been part of the relief team but found herself just as helpless in the face of The Collapse as her colleagues.\nThe appearance of The Scissors only worsened the situation as they lit a fire under all the contradictions of this “new world.”\nHer heart, confused by all that had unfolded, Celestia turned to her mother, who was now a high-level P.U.S executive, for help. The answer she received? Delve deeper into the latest cutting-edge studies and operational management techniques. Being distracted and worrying about the unimportant was the last thing she wanted for Celestia.\nGo on, and shine like the brightest star!",

    "5_Text": "Transitioning from initial military and heavy infrastructure industries to civilian tech, Preton City has witnessed Strinova's remarkable rise from nothing. Situated on the remote fringes, Preton bears the arduous tasks of energy development, mining, exploration, and resource transport. While these high risks bring substantial rewards, they also attract various factions. Gold prospectors, mining guilds, arms dealers, private mercenaries, and undercover agents from different organizations operate here. The intense competition over mineral wealth has turned Preton into a battleground of rivalries.",
    "8_Text": "Strinova's initial state was an unstable wilderness, where the string sequences were chaotic, disordered, and fluid. Strinovians venturing into this wilderness often experienced Reverstring due to the dimensional instability, ultimately leading to their dissolution.\nConsequently, P.U.S designated the wilderness as a restricted zone. The \"True Wilderness\" environment was also utilized by P.U.S in the defensive mechanisms of the Komos Tower.",
    "3_Text": "Neutroville holds two-thirds of Strinova's wealth, mostly controlled by a few financial oligarchs in Area 88. Rumor has it, owning property in Neutroville is the ultimate dream for Strinova's elite, making it a hotspot for fortune seekers and earning the name \"City of Wealth.\" This area also features Port Euler, the thriving heart of trade in Strinova.\nUnder tight protection from the P.U.S government, Neutroville is the safest city in Strinova. However, The Scissors have codenamed Neutroville as the \"Vault,\" marking it as a key attack objective.",
    "2_Text": "Bablo Crystals are formed by various string patterns, randomly scattered throughout the True Wilderness. They are the foundational material and energy source of Strinova. Bablo Crystals consist of two parts: the crystal itself and the mixed-in void matter. For Strinovians, void matter is useless and needs to be removed through purification.",
    "7_Text": "The initial landing site in Strinova was on the border of the Seeda Peninsula. In this barren, arid, yet stable desert, humanity sought knowledge about this new world and established a temporary settlement.\nHowever, it was far from the paradise they had hoped for. Seasonal spatial tempests and whirling sands seemed to rule this land eternally. Once-standing fortresses over the sand seas are now buried ruins, along with early research records, lying dormant until the disaster known as \"The Collapse\" comes knocking again.",
    "6_Text": "Base S12 lies in the desolate True Wilderness. A century ago, P.U.S established a dimensional city here and conducted Strinova's largest dimension experiment. After the experiment failed, P.U.S shifted its focus to more stable inland areas, leaving S12 forgotten.\nThe Scissors, uncovering leftover fragments and equipment, took over the spatial rift research and transformed the area into the new Base S12 City. They repurposed the abandoned Komos Tower into the Red Tower, ensuring regional stability while enhancing stealth and reconnaissance. A spatial bridge was also constructed within the tower, serving as a gateway to various regions. Although The Scissors later developed new city sections, many core members continue to reside here, making S12 their political hub.",
    "4_Text": "Facing the escalating Bablo Energy crisis in Strinova, the P.U.S government and the Urbino Business Alliance partnered to create the dimensional city of Strian. Designed as a hub for new energy and green initiatives, Strian, known as the \"City of Life,\" became a beacon for naturalists and biologists seeking fresh survival strategies for Strinovians.\nBut with the rise of risky biochemical mishaps in Strinovian tech development, Urbino secretly joined forces with The Scissors to mitigate these risks and relieve P.U.S pressure. By controlling resource access, Urbino diluted P.U.S's scientific power, straining their alliance and setting the stage for future turmoil in Strian.",
    "1_Text": "As Earth's energy depleted, humanity, propelled by string theory, discovered a multiverse. They used Bablo Crystals from this space to create bodies suited for multidimensional existence, built cities, and named the realm Strinova.\nHowever, this progress came at a cost; every century, the string sequences in the residents' bodies begin to decay. As dreams of a utopia faded, diverse faiths and ideologies fractured society, steering the new world into turmoil...",
