Gazing at the practice room mirror, she's long imagined seeing this side of herself, displaying a musical prowess that none could match.\nBut when she finally saw who she wanted to see, it was in the lounge at night, body covered in a conductor's coat.\n“Huh? Did I mess something up? Kanami just wanted to give the Navigator a surprise... After all, Lawine and the other said as much, and even gave me such beautiful clothes...”\nKanami lowers her head, a flurry of emotions on her red face.\nSurprise, self-blame, bashfulness...\n“A-Are you surprised? I...”\nHer face becomes redder, and she fumbles over herself even more.\n“I-I'll definitely become your favorite idol!”\nThe girl speaks while covering her face with a sheet of music. The conductor in front of her gives a simple nod and starts turning to leave.\nFeelings were conveyed, albeit with a misunderstanding.\nBut even so... this still counts as being bold and achieving one's goal... doesn't it?",
    "6_Content": "“It's you. No need to worry. I'm not the most experienced in classical music, but I'm familiar with music theory.”\nWhen the sunset comes, the lone shadow in the practice room finally comes to a stop.\n“Not good enough again... No, I guess it can count as a success. What do you think, Navigator?”\nThe lone figure keeps their distance, holding their saxophone.\n“...I wouldn't feel very comfortable being so close, but if you feel it will help you conduct, I won't voice any complaints.”\nLawine speaks calmly, maintaining a mysterious profile in the sunset.\nA calming and nostalgic étude is played once more.\nOne can't help but be confident that the performance will be one that lingers in the memory.",
    "3_Content": "“Bai Mo suddenly dumped this task on me. I'm really a little... uh... unconfident.”\nIn the practice room, Maddelena looks at me with a violin in her hand. Through her glasses, I can see a lost look on her pale and youthful face.\n“I really... uhm... what if my sister sees? Eh...? Just let you guide me? Treat it as a paintbrush...?”\nInstead of replying, I simply raise my baton and start conducting with the score. Maddelena makes a lot of harsh and pained sounds, and it takes till dark for us to get the atmosphere right.\n“Can you feel it, Navigator? In this way, even someone ordinary like me can keep up with someone like Bai Mo...!”\nShe's got it the wrong way around. The ordinary timbre is the most important part of any performance. Without the violin's thread, the entire performance may as well be empty talk.\nMaddelena's shy smile gives off the airs of a reserved calmness that is hers alone. With it, one can't help but be intoxicated by the sound of the music...",
    "4_Content": "Outside the practice room, I hear the sound of piano movements slowly flowing out from a crack in the door.\nEven after I open the door, the girl remains focused. Her light, slender fingers dance along the black and white keys, continuing until they strike the last note on a black.\n“Music is fascinating. It's so different from medicine and anything else I've dabbled in. It's so easy to get drawn in without even noticing.”\nAs she speaks, she lifts the little hat on her head and shoots me a playful wink.\n“Want to try piano four hands? You won't be able to conduct properly without giving it a go.”\nBefore I can react, Kokona pulls me to her side.\n“Don't worry, just follow my lead.”\nOur melody steadily blooms into a cheerful dance of keys.\nKokona might be right. If you spend all your time on the podium, you lose sight of the full picture.\n“I'm looking forward to the performance. If we could continue playing together in the future... I think I'd like that.”\nThere's a hint of caring expectation in her smile...",

    "2_Content": "When I arrived at the practice room, I found Bai Mo already perched in a chair, hard at work on his études, glancing at me through the corner of his eye.\n“What do you think, friend? A good pitch, is it not?”\nI must admit that Bai Mo is quite the accomplished musician. Knowing his unreliable nature, it's hard to imagine he could be as elegant and gentle as he is now.\n“Come and conduct. Let's have a proper practice performance.”\nI raise my baton and extend an invitation for him to begin.\n“Alright! Check this out!”\nThe tuba becomes spirited, moving in lockstep with the conductor's baton and leading the rhythm - most fitting for Bai Mo, indeed.\n“Capital, my friend! But now is not the time to trade compliments. There is still much work to be done.”\nThe corners of his mouth are raised in expectation. It seems that he has all the faith in the world that I'll make this a success.",

    "1_Content": "At the start of the new year, a special invitation from Urbino was handed to you.\nThis message comes from Bai Mo, head of the Urbino Business Alliance. Having been inspired to celebrate the New Year with music, Bai Mo has called for talented musicians from far and wide to participate in the event.\nYet Bai Mo has greatly underestimated the opinions of these talented individuals, and their rift I fear is so great as to have destroyed any promise of this great performance. It is for this reason I especially wanted to pass this letter to you...\n“There's no time, my friend. Only you can help me now! Only you can put these weirdos... Ahem, I mean, only you can get everyone on the same page to make this performance a success. I'm counting on you!”\n                                               - Bai Mo",

How did you manage to show up at the exact moment Lawine entered Kidd Hall?\n     - “Why do you think I had cameras installed, Navigator? As a competent member of the Phantom Thieves, I adjusted my time of arrival based on the situation to ensure the item would be unveiled on time.”\n\n- Why did you plan a bomb? I don't get it.\n     - “Because I wanted something fun! Besides, I had to blow up the surveillance devices and the secret passage.

Besides that, I was also the person responsible for the secret passage. I'd wanted them to have the item for a while. It was more fun than purchasing it and giving it to them.”\n\n- What about the codes on the clue cards? According to your plan, Lawine and the others wouldn't have known about you.\n     - “You figured that out as well, Navigator? Well, I thought it would be cool, that's all. You know me. I'm an indispensable member of the Phantom Thieves. The family has to stay together.”\n\n- Was the self-portrait of Mr. Black Cat a part of your plan as well?\n     - “How dare you...

Celestia mulled over how to respond.\nChildren cannot understand the complexities of collapse syndrome, but they can see its effects on people. Someone they know will suddenly change in temperament, become argumentative, and start having endless quarrels, frictions, and conflicts with their relatives - a once-happy family completely destroyed.\nIn the face of the child's personal pain, it felt as if any words she could speak would be powerless to heal his wounds.\nCelestia didn't have a response. She knew that his parents were still alive, but with the affliction of collapse syndrome, they might as well have been different people. What would happen to the children left behind? What would be their future?\nShe would do her best to calm the mind of the young ones under her care. As she gazed upon their young sleeping faces, she imagined that she could heal the scars deep within their minds, bit by bit.\nUrbino's funding solved her financial issues, but Celestia still lacked reliable partners. Her only choice was to take on more and more work. Early days and long nights became commonplace. To keep herself awake, Celestia came up with a brew she called Starlight Coffee. The bittersweet and refreshing drink became one of her daily little pleasures.\nThe Astral Sanctuary has gradually earned a reputation. Those who have received her care will never forget Celestia. But she remained alone.\nAt least, until the Navigator came into her life...\nPerhaps Celestia, regarded as a “star” by her patients, will finally receive a “star” of her own?",

Kokona wasn't expecting much. Nevertheless, she painstakingly repeated the story of her assignment and Mister Sea Bunny's past and present life.\n“If that's the case, why don't you just ask him? If he could choose, what would Mister Sea Bunny like to do?”\nBefore she could say anything else, the girl was quickly called away by an older woman bearing the uniform of a PUS executive.\nKokona can still clearly recall the brilliant starry pattern on that girl's dress, along with her carefree advice.",

But all this meant was that what happened was even more of a surprise.\nThe company's executive director was assassinated, her parents' safety was threatened, and the company entered a deep crisis.\nIn a calculated strike, Blaise's faction in the family defected en masse, selling their stocks to competitors at discount prices, resulting in huge losses to the family's position.\nWhen Audrey and her father attempted to take charge of the situation and rally the family, their speeches were met with ridicule and blank stares. Having seized control of the narrative, their opponents called for a vote and ruthlessly expelled father and daughter from the family.\nThe sudden betrayal made Audrey raise her defenses even higher. She could trust no one but her parents.\nTo preserve what remained of the family's business, Audrey announced that she would be delisting the company as she explored new avenues.\nNow a house divided, the outside world sees the sun setting on the Grove family.

What's up with the pair of long ears?”\n“Correction. The 'antennas' on this device are biosensors designed to imitate those on sea bunnies.”\n“So... You're not a rabbit?

During the day, Galatea would either be missing or returning home with strange, wriggling “materials,” while at night, she would suddenly appear out of nowhere like a ghost. These antics delivered no shortage of frights to poor Maddelena.\nNevertheless, Maddelena covered for her sister when she could, protecting Galatea from their parents' questioning.\nIn this way, Maddelena developed a habit of being helpful to those around her. Whenever she was out collecting materials for her art, she would always try to help those she encountered. It wasn't long before she had earned high esteem among her neighbors.\nFor this innocent girl, it seemed that making others happy was enough.",
