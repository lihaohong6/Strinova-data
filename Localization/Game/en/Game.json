No, I guess it can count as a success. What do you think, Navigator?”\nThe lone figure keeps their distance, holding their saxophone.\n“...I wouldn't feel very comfortable being so close, but if you feel it will help you conduct, I won't voice any complaints.”\nLawine speaks calmly, maintaining a mysterious profile in the sunset.\nA calming and nostalgic étude is played once more.\nOne can't help but be confident that the performance will be one that lingers in the memory.",
    "3_Content": "“Bai Mo suddenly dumped this task on me. I'm really a little... uh... unconfident.”\nIn the practice room, Maddelena looks at me with a violin in her hand. Through her glasses, I can see a lost look on her pale and youthful face.\n“I really... uhm... what if my sister sees? Eh...? Just let you guide me? Treat it as a paintbrush...?”\nInstead of replying, I simply raise my baton and start conducting with the score. Maddelena makes a lot of harsh and pained sounds, and it takes till dark for us to get the atmosphere right.\n“Can you feel it, Navigator? In this way, even someone ordinary like me can keep up with someone like Bai Mo...!”\nShe's got it the wrong way around. The ordinary timbre is the most important part of any performance. Without the violin's thread, the entire performance may as well be empty talk.\nMaddelena's shy smile gives off the airs of a reserved calmness that is hers alone. With it, one can't help but be intoxicated by the sound of the music...",
    "4_Content": "Outside the practice room, I hear the sound of piano movements slowly flowing out from a crack in the door.\nEven after I open the door, the girl remains focused. Her light, slender fingers dance along the black and white keys, continuing until they strike the last note on a black.\n“Music is fascinating. It's so different from medicine and anything else I've dabbled in. It's so easy to get drawn in without even noticing.”\nAs she speaks, she lifts the little hat on her head and shoots me a playful wink.\n“Want to try piano four hands? You won't be able to conduct properly without giving it a go.”\nBefore I can react, Kokona pulls me to her side.\n“Don't worry, just follow my lead.”\nOur melody steadily blooms into a cheerful dance of keys.\nKokona might be right. If you spend all your time on the podium, you lose sight of the full picture.\n“I'm looking forward to the performance. If we could continue playing together in the future... I think I'd like that.”\nThere's a hint of caring expectation in her smile...",

    "2_Content": "When I arrived at the practice room, I found Bai Mo already perched in a chair, hard at work on his études, glancing at me through the corner of his eye.\n“What do you think, friend? A good pitch, is it not?”\nI must admit that Bai Mo is quite the accomplished musician. Knowing his unreliable nature, it's hard to imagine he could be as elegant and gentle as he is now.\n“Come and conduct. Let's have a proper practice performance.”\nI raise my baton and extend an invitation for him to begin.\n“Alright! Check this out!”\nThe tuba becomes spirited, moving in lockstep with the conductor's baton and leading the rhythm - most fitting for Bai Mo, indeed.\n“Capital, my friend! But now is not the time to trade compliments. There is still much work to be done.”\nThe corners of his mouth are raised in expectation. It seems that he has all the faith in the world that I'll make this a success.",

It is for this reason I especially wanted to pass this letter to you...\n“There's no time, my friend. Only you can help me now! Only you can put these weirdos... Ahem, I mean, only you can get everyone on the same page to make this performance a success. I'm counting on you!”\n                                               - Bai Mo",

    "14605_StoryContent": "- “Celestia, why don't Mom and Dad remember me anymore?”\nThe question was asked by a young patient sent to the Astral Sanctuary. Celestia mulled over how to respond.\nChildren cannot understand the complexities of collapse syndrome, but they can see its effects on people. Someone they know will suddenly change in temperament, become argumentative, and start having endless quarrels, frictions, and conflicts with their relatives - a once-happy family completely destroyed.\nIn the face of the child's personal pain, it felt as if any words she could speak would be powerless to heal his wounds.\nCelestia didn't have a response. She knew that his parents were still alive, but with the affliction of collapse syndrome, they might as well have been different people. What would happen to the children left behind? What would be their future?\nShe would do her best to calm the mind of the young ones under her care. As she gazed upon their young sleeping faces, she imagined that she could heal the scars deep within their minds, bit by bit.\nUrbino's funding solved her financial issues, but Celestia still lacked reliable partners. Her only choice was to take on more and more work. Early days and long nights became commonplace. To keep herself awake, Celestia came up with a brew she called Starlight Coffee. The bittersweet and refreshing drink became one of her daily little pleasures.\nThe Astral Sanctuary has gradually earned a reputation. Those who have received her care will never forget Celestia. But she remained alone.\nAt least, until the Navigator came into her life...\nPerhaps Celestia, regarded as a “star” by her patients, will finally receive a “star” of her own?",

But she had never given much thought to the purpose of her designs. Kokona resolved to find a task befitting of Mister Sea Bunny.\nHis light frame provided excellent aerodynamics. He had a wide field of vision. His small size meant he could squeeze through gaps and navigate difficult terrain. The most suitable task would be...\n“Arrrrgh! I've got nothing!!” Kokona scratched her head in distress as she paced through campus.\nAttention drawn by the ruckus, a girl slightly younger than Kokona popped her head around the corner. “Excuse me - is there something bothering you?”\nPerhaps she just needed someone to vent to. Kokona wasn't expecting much. Nevertheless, she painstakingly repeated the story of her assignment and Mister Sea Bunny's past and present life.\n“If that's the case, why don't you just ask him? If he could choose, what would Mister Sea Bunny like to do?”\nBefore she could say anything else, the girl was quickly called away by an older woman bearing the uniform of a PUS executive.\nKokona can still clearly recall the brilliant starry pattern on that girl's dress, along with her carefree advice.",

But all this meant was that what happened was even more of a surprise.\nThe company's executive director was assassinated, her parents' safety was threatened, and the company entered a deep crisis.\nIn a calculated strike, Blaise's faction in the family defected en masse, selling their stocks to competitors at discount prices, resulting in huge losses to the family's position.\nWhen Audrey and her father attempted to take charge of the situation and rally the family, their speeches were met with ridicule and blank stares. Having seized control of the narrative, their opponents called for a vote and ruthlessly expelled father and daughter from the family.\nThe sudden betrayal made Audrey raise her defenses even higher. She could trust no one but her parents.\nTo preserve what remained of the family's business, Audrey announced that she would be delisting the company as she explored new avenues.\nNow a house divided, the outside world sees the sun setting on the Grove family. But Audrey knows that a true Grove stands proud and unyielding, pure and eternal.",

We do appreciate your interest in robotics, but I feel obliged to say that we won't be able to admit you based on just that.”\n“Don't worry! Don't worry! There's more to my story. After that, I dismantled Mister Sea Bunny down to his core components!”\n“You're saying you managed to disassemble a robot at such a young age? Impressive, but I'll need to hear more.”\n“What if I told you I put him back together? Check it out! Doesn't he look more like a sea bunny now?”\n“Hm. Not bad for a student. But there's a fatal flaw.”\nFaced with Kokona's blank expression, the admissions officer let out a sigh.\n“Listen carefully. What you have now is just an empty shell with a cute face. Kokona, machines should also have their own souls.”\nKokona let out a slight frown of dejection. She had never thought about this.\nThe admissions officer was right. She had turned Mister Sea Bunny into nothing more than a sophisticated toy.\nShe wasn't looking forward to telling her parents about this rejection...\n...\n“Your first piece of homework will be finding him a soul.”\n“Eh?

Love, mom and dad.”\nKokona always received a letter and gift from her far-away parents for her birthday. The contents would vary greatly from year to year, from strange dolls to exquisite fabrics... Every time Kokona was about to open a gift, she would make a guess and comment on what she received during the next video call. It was the special little ritual of her family.\nKokona would have never been able to guess what she received this time - a round, barrel-shaped housekeeping bot.\nThough she'd seen all manner of strange antiques and artifacts, this was the first time Kokona had come into contact with such advanced technology.\nBoasting a simple design, powerful, cutting-edge materials, and the power of AI, these bots gave Kokona an entirely new sense of wonder.\nWhen she pressed the power button, the sensor on the top of the bot would spin around like a pair of rabbit ears.\n“Mister Robot, are you a rabbit? What's up with the pair of long ears?”\n“Correction. The 'antennas' on this device are biosensors designed to imitate those on sea bunnies.”\n“So... You're not a rabbit? Should I call you Mister Sea Bunny?”\n“Unknown command. Owner may be attempting to register 'Mister Sea Bunny' as the username of this machine. Please confirm.”\n“I don't get it...

A gamer always keeps their promise!”\nEvery time Investigator George heads out on a mission, this is the little send-off he shares with his daughter. A gamer’s promise is set in stone, no backing out, no skipping out.\nWhenever duty calls, he always makes it home in time to dive into their cherished game together—Superheroes of Justice. Their gaming sessions on the family console are some of the rare moments they share.\nWith Dad commanding the fiery powerhouse Mighty Meow, and his daughter as the trusty sidekick Pawtector, they team up to take down the sinister demon dragon. Speedrunning the game calls for a mix of bravery and creativity, cultivating Michele's unique \"gamer mindset\" and molding her into an epic gamer.\nWithout even realizing it, Michele brings that gamer mindset into her everyday life, adopting a bold and unconventional approach to things.\nHer open-minded father supports her adventurous spirit, encouraging her to fearlessly chase whatever her heart desires.\n“Follow your instincts and dive headfirst—that's the true gamer's way!”",

On that rainy day, her father left in a hurry, his expression grave. Unlike usual, he gave no promise of when he'd return. Days of unrelenting rain engulfed Elmond, but no word came from afar about her father.\nEventually, what felt like an eternity passed, and the storms eased just a little. Michele received a call from the Investigation Bureau. They informed her of her father's plight—he had been attacked and had fallen victim to Collapse Syndrome. His duties were suspended indefinitely.\nMichele steadfastly believed her father's suspension was due to injury, not misconduct. However, the whispers of gossip and slander were relentless.\nJust like in Superheroes of Justice, where a hero falls before fulfilling their mission, her father returned from his assignment in a deep coma.

As the responsible agency, P.U.S attached great importance to the reports and promptly assigned personnel to assist.\nBut these efforts bore few results. As the medical community was still locked in debate, the outbreak of The Collapse began.\nAs a member of P.U.S, Celestia had been part of the relief team but found herself just as helpless in the face of The Collapse as her colleagues.\nThe appearance of The Scissors only worsened the situation as they lit a fire under all the contradictions of this “new world.”\nHer heart, confused by all that had unfolded, Celestia turned to her mother, who was now a high-level P.U.S executive, for help. The answer she received? Delve deeper into the latest cutting-edge studies and operational management techniques. Being distracted and worrying about the unimportant was the last thing she wanted for Celestia.\nGo on, and shine like the brightest star!",
