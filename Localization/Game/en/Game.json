    "5_Content": "“Navigator! Wait, no... It's 'conductor' now... you're here! Let's get started!”\nKanami's face is full of enthusiasm. Gazing at the practice room mirror, she's long imagined seeing this side of herself, displaying a musical prowess that none could match.\nBut when she finally saw who she wanted to see, it was in the lounge at night, body covered in a conductor's coat.\n“Huh? Did I mess something up? Kanami just wanted to give the Navigator a surprise... After all, Lawine and the other said as much, and even gave me such beautiful clothes...”\nKanami lowers her head, a flurry of emotions on her red face.\nSurprise, self-blame, bashfulness...\n“A-Are you surprised? I...”\nHer face becomes redder, and she fumbles over herself even more.\n“I-I'll definitely become your favorite idol!”\nThe girl speaks while covering her face with a sheet of music. The conductor in front of her gives a simple nod and starts turning to leave.\nFeelings were conveyed, albeit with a misunderstanding.\nBut even so... this still counts as being bold and achieving one's goal... doesn't it?",
    "6_Content": "“It's you. No need to worry. I'm not the most experienced in classical music, but I'm familiar with music theory.”\nWhen the sunset comes, the lone shadow in the practice room finally comes to a stop.\n“Not good enough again... No, I guess it can count as a success. What do you think, Navigator?”\nThe lone figure keeps their distance, holding their saxophone.\n“...I wouldn't feel very comfortable being so close, but if you feel it will help you conduct, I won't voice any complaints.”\nLawine speaks calmly, maintaining a mysterious profile in the sunset.\nA calming and nostalgic étude is played once more.\nOne can't help but be confident that the performance will be one that lingers in the memory.",
    "3_Content": "“Bai Mo suddenly dumped this task on me. I'm really a little... uh... unconfident.”\nIn the practice room, Maddelena looks at me with a violin in her hand. Through her glasses, I can see a lost look on her pale and youthful face.\n“I really... uhm... what if my sister sees? Eh...? Just let you guide me? Treat it as a paintbrush...?”\nInstead of replying, I simply raise my baton and start conducting with the score. Maddelena makes a lot of harsh and pained sounds, and it takes till dark for us to get the atmosphere right.\n“Can you feel it, Navigator? In this way, even someone ordinary like me can keep up with someone like Bai Mo...!”\nShe's got it the wrong way around. The ordinary timbre is the most important part of any performance. Without the violin's thread, the entire performance may as well be empty talk.\nMaddelena's shy smile gives off the airs of a reserved calmness that is hers alone. With it, one can't help but be intoxicated by the sound of the music...",
    "4_Content": "Outside the practice room, I hear the sound of piano movements slowly flowing out from a crack in the door.\nEven after I open the door, the girl remains focused. Her light, slender fingers dance along the black and white keys, continuing until they strike the last note on a black.\n“Music is fascinating. It's so different from medicine and anything else I've dabbled in. It's so easy to get drawn in without even noticing.”\nAs she speaks, she lifts the little hat on her head and shoots me a playful wink.\n“Want to try piano four hands? You won't be able to conduct properly without giving it a go.”\nBefore I can react, Kokona pulls me to her side.\n“Don't worry, just follow my lead.”\nOur melody steadily blooms into a cheerful dance of keys.\nKokona might be right. If you spend all your time on the podium, you lose sight of the full picture.\n“I'm looking forward to the performance. If we could continue playing together in the future... I think I'd like that.”\nThere's a hint of caring expectation in her smile...",

    "2_Content": "When I arrived at the practice room, I found Bai Mo already perched in a chair, hard at work on his études, glancing at me through the corner of his eye.\n“What do you think, friend? A good pitch, is it not?”\nI must admit that Bai Mo is quite the accomplished musician. Knowing his unreliable nature, it's hard to imagine he could be as elegant and gentle as he is now.\n“Come and conduct. Let's have a proper practice performance.”\nI raise my baton and extend an invitation for him to begin.\n“Alright! Check this out!”\nThe tuba becomes spirited, moving in lockstep with the conductor's baton and leading the rhythm - most fitting for Bai Mo, indeed.\n“Capital, my friend! But now is not the time to trade compliments. There is still much work to be done.”\nThe corners of his mouth are raised in expectation.

    "22_ContentAside": "       The Origin\n       During a routine operation of The Scissors, Ming learns crucial information: The “top secret item” previously stolen by The Scissors is to be auctioned at [Kidd Hall of Laurel Hall]. The starting bid of the item is extremely high. It is also guarded closely due to its high security level. The organization can neither afford to outbid everyone nor can it seize it before the auction.\n       “Take back what is rightfully yours.” - this is one of The Scissors' mottos. Led by Lawine, Operation Black Cat, a plan to retrieve the item, is initiated.\n\n       The Plan\n       The team scouts Laurel Hall, the target location. Composed of [Philharmonia Hall] and [Kidd Hall] side by side, Laurel Hall is one of the most famous music venues of Urbino.\nIntel suggested that the auction will take place at [Kidd Hall]. On the same day, the idol Kanami has been invited to perform at [Philharmonia Hall] next door. The auction and the concert are scheduled to start and end at the same time.\n       Ming makes two significant discoveries during the reconnaissance mission:\n1. [Kidd Hall] and [Philharmonia Hall] used to be connected by a passage, likely abandoned during renovation. The passage has now been sealed, leaving behind only a gap too narrow for ordinary folks. However, it should be a piece of cake for a Superstring.\n2.       The staff of [Kidd Hall] have marked the locations of the auction items prior to the event.\n       As the team discusses their operation, Kanami comes up with a plan to add a segment of <Outline_14>{aside1}</> magic show at the end of her concert. Ming and Lawine will act as performers. <Outline_14>{aside2}</>. The details of the plan are as follows:\n       1. Ming plays a temporary performer, Lady M, hiding inside the compartment of the magic black box.\n       2. Lawine plays a temporary performer, Lady L. She is to take the stage with Kanami and enter the magic box.\n       3. Ming and Lawine switch places inside the box. As Ming steps out of the box, Lawine is to enter the secret passage, follow it all the way to the spot under the final auction item in [Kidd Hall], and secure the item once the opportunity arises. After the performance ends, Lawine is to find an opportunity and make her exit.\n       4. <Outline_14>{aside3}</>, the audience will be unable to realize that the performer coming out for a curtain call is, in fact, Ming rather than Lawine. Kanami will lead the audience to believe that Lawine has completed a “<Outline_14>{aside4}</>” inside the compressing black box.\n       5. Thus, Operation Black Cat will have given the audience a brilliant performance, providing a cast-iron alibi for every performer at the same time. No one will suspect The Scissors next door for the theft of the auction item.\n       After the discussion, everyone begins to make separate preparations. Soon, it is the day of the operation.\n\n       The Operation\n       On the day of the operation, the magic show goes as planned. Kanami, Ming, and Lawine coordinate perfectly as a team. Having switched places with Ming inside the box, Lawine successfully infiltrates Kidd Hall. She is one step away from the final auction item.\nAt the same time, Bai Mo enters Kidd Hall in a ridiculous costume. The sole light source shines on the special guest, drawing everyone's attention. Seizing the opportunity, Lawine picks the lock and steals the final auction item, leaving behind a work of her own.\n       Bai Mo takes the stage to lift up the cover of the auction item only to reveal a self-portrait of Mr. Black Cat, the same character he is dressed up as.\n\n       <Outline_14>{aside5}</>",
    "23_ContentAside": "- Multiple clue cards mention surveillance footage. Who installed the cameras?\n     - “Me, the mastermind, of course. I knew exactly where everyone was.”\n\n- Did you really forget about the time? How did you manage to show up at the exact moment Lawine entered Kidd Hall?\n     - “Why do you think I had cameras installed, Navigator? As a competent member of the Phantom Thieves, I adjusted my time of arrival based on the situation to ensure the item would be unveiled on time.”\n\n- Why did you plan a bomb? I don't get it.\n     - “Because I wanted something fun! Besides, I had to blow up the surveillance devices and the secret passage. I wasn't going to tell everyone that Kanami and the gang stole the final auction item.”\n\n- Had I failed to solve the puzzle in time, would you still have detonated the bomb?\n     - “While I had other methods to take out the cameras without the risk of injuries, Navigator, I knew what you were capable of. A simple puzzle was a piece of cake for you.”\n\n- Does that mean you gave Ming the details of the auction item?\n     - “Not bad. Did you notice my call? Besides that, I was also the person responsible for the secret passage. I'd wanted them to have the item for a while. It was more fun than purchasing it and giving it to them.”\n\n- What about the codes on the clue cards? According to your plan, Lawine and the others wouldn't have known about you.\n     - “You figured that out as well, Navigator? Well, I thought it would be cool, that's all. You know me. I'm an indispensable member of the Phantom Thieves. The family has to stay together.”\n\n- Was the self-portrait of Mr. Black Cat a part of your plan as well?\n     - “How dare you... No, certainly not. I could never have expected it! They've ruined my reputation...”\n\n- What exactly was the final auction item?\n     - “I can't tell you. Why don't you ask The Scissors?

    "128102031_TextContext": "It's a tradition of my family dōjō. When passing on one's legacy to a disciple, it is customary for the disciple to hold a ceremony as a show of respect and gratitude. We can do this through tea.",

    "128202052_TextContext": "So that's where you work...?",
    "128203010_TextContext": "It's you... but why are you dressed up like that?",
    "128203097_TextContext": "You were going to pick up some goods, right? I'm happy to come with you if you don't mind.",

    "128101033_TextContext": "Oh? It's to your liking?",
    "128102035_TextContext": "Only with this peace, can I truly face that person...",
    "128203078_TextContext": "Oh, sorry about that. It must've been unpleasant.",
    "128201006_TextContext": "Oh. It's you.",
    "128204073_TextContext": "Tsk, I got distracted in practice...",
    "128203026_TextContext": "Tsk. Looks like they caught on to my scent.",
    "128204129_TextContext": "Mm-hmm...",
    "128201068_TextContext": "Mmm... I should be able to go faster. There are more ways to save time than I expected.",
    "128204113_TextContext": "How do I put this... Your tips probably helped.",
    "128201024_TextContext": "Mm. It's not a big deal.",
    "128202065_TextContext": "Hm. The wound is recovering nicely. As expected, there was only a small amount of bleeding.",
    "128204022_TextContext": "Good. As long as you're interested.",
    "128202038_TextContext": "I do, but it's mostly for minor injuries.",
    "128203020_TextContext": "Yeah. I've been staying behind to make sure everyone gets out.",
    "128204103_TextContext": "I understand now.",
    "128102016_TextContext": "It's fine, I'll wait here. We should finish our last conversation in person.",

    "128201052_TextContext": "Mm... what a wonderful collection of words. I'm taking my time to appreciate them carefully.",
    "128101075_TextContext": "That's true. Seeing is believing - rumors are never quite reliable.",
    "128202078_TextContext": "Looks like the bleeding has stopped.",
    "128102008_TextContext": "I won't, thank you.",

    "231103045_TextContext": "If we look at the bombings, they've all happened at different times and places. The perpetrator isn't a lone wolf, but an organized group.",
    "231102040_TextContext": "The receptionist only told me that Mr. Bai had said that a young lady would come looking for him today.",
    "231105027_TextContext": "They have their duty, and I must perform mine, too.",
    "231107177_TextContext": "They responded quickly. Once The Scissors showed up, things were resolved soon enough.",

    "231102138_TextContext": "The future of the victims and the glory of the unicorn... they're both in your hands.",
    "231102027_TextContext": "But you are not prey. Your scent is different... it's pure, complex, strange...",
    "231106130_TextContext": "But detonating this mine is the best option I can think of right now.",
    "231102116_TextContext": "But as an independent institution, the Astral Sanctuary can interfere with the Grove's affairs... have I got that right?",

    "231101060_TextContext": "As a show of thanks... would you like to enjoy a cup of Starlight Coffee with me? If you don't mind, of course.",
    "231103070_TextContext": "The battle plan is simple. Once we see The Scissors' operatives, we'll sneak up on them and make our move!",

    "231106073_TextContext": "Listen up, you impostors! This is Captain Ming of The Scissors!",
    "231104062_TextContext": "You'll see soon enough. The destruction of Komos Tower is an omen.",

    "231104077_TextContext": "You are clearly a talented man. Why don't you use your skills to protect the city?",

    "231104170_TextContext": "What you're saying is... the enemy is hiding another target amongst all the noise...?",
    "231104091_TextContext": "Your actions will result in many people getting hurt... or saved. The choice is yours.",
    "231104084_TextContext": "Do you really think so?",
    "231102098_TextContext": "It's not Urbino that has you in a rush.",

    "231103078_TextContext": "What did you say?! Follow him!!! Wait, no, defuse the bomb!!!",
    "231104071_TextContext": "What did you say?! Team 103 wasn't a piece of cake...",

    "231105079_TextContext": "Our duty is to protect your safety.",
    "231107128_TextContext": "We keep a lot of things in our vaults. There's no way I can remember them all.",
    "231106082_TextContext": "Believe what you want. Just leave this place to us. You can rest for now.",
    "231104041_TextContext": "Nobunaga isn't here?",
    "231105024_TextContext": "Hopefully, there's some good news from the Bureau of Investigation that will help calm public opinion and buy us some time.",
    "231104136_TextContext": "Great job, Michele! Open the emergency channel. I need to make a public announcement!",
    "231107104_TextContext": "We'll worry about it later. We don't have the strength to chase them, anyway.",

    "231101103_TextContext": "Ehm... To be honest, I don't know much about him. We've never met.",
    "231101038_TextContext": "To be honest... I was already awake when you covered me with the blanket.",
    "231106107_TextContext": "Actually, I was planning to leave one round for myself.",
    "231107101_TextContext": "Farewell, P.U.S warriors!",
    "231107112_TextContext": "I'm going to throw up if you keep shaking me, Michele.",

    "231107117_TextContext": "What was that anchor link I just felt from you...?",
    "231106125_TextContext": "I just checked the P.U.S database.",
    "231103077_TextContext": "I just saw someone in the queue place one at the cashier's desk and slip away...",
    "231102052_TextContext": "Nice to meet you. Are you two his... representatives?",
    "231105062_TextContext": "D-Don't be afraid! She's alone!",
    "231105011_TextContext": "Don't think I'll go easy on you just because you're hiding among the ignorant!",
    "231106137_TextContext": "Don't worry about that. I have to do my part to help.",
    "231103065_TextContext": "Don't jump to conclusions so quickly.",
    "231106022_TextContext": "Don't rush. Let me take a look.",
    "231102008_TextContext": "I'm coming up with a plan.",
    "231107182_TextContext": "Don't blame me, Audrey... You should have learned not to go beyond your station.",
    "231107079_TextContext": "You will not escape!",
    "231103071_TextContext": "Worry not. I've made a mental note of what all their primary operatives look like. Even if it's Ming or Lawine, I won't be afraid!",
    "231101031_TextContext": "Don't worry, I'll take care of it.",
    "231105067_TextContext": "Don't give up!",
    "231104059_TextContext": "Don't waste your time. The “Great Awakening” is about to begin. The Scissors will bring a new dawn to this world.",
    "231101069_TextContext": "It's no rush. We need you in tip-top shape.",
    "231103138_TextContext": "Stop hiding, Scissor! I can see you!",
    "231105009_TextContext": "Not a step back! They're hoarding all our emergency supplies!",
    "231104085_TextContext": "Don't lie to yourself.",
    "231105052_TextContext": "There's so many of them...!",
    "231102033_TextContext": "Navigator! This way, this way!",

    "231101065_TextContext": "Navigator... you won't hate it, will you?",
    "231103132_TextContext": "Navigator... Michele's already rushed in! We need to follow her!",
    "231107108_TextContext": "Navigator!",
    "231101080_TextContext": "Navigator, look at this!",
    "231101058_TextContext": "Navigator, thank you for accompanying me and helping so many patients.",
    "231102006_TextContext": "Navigator? Don't tell me you dragged me to the Urbino HQ without a plan...",
    "231106074_TextContext": "The Scissors...?",
    "231104034_TextContext": "Do The Scissors intend to start an all-out war?",
    "231106080_TextContext": "You're a Scissor! Weren't you the ones who planned this attack?",
    "231106042_TextContext": "Give it up, Scissor!",
    "231102114_TextContext": "We'll need the power of the unicorn for that.",
    "231101046_TextContext": "We'll shoulder the responsibility together.",
    "231104162_TextContext": "It's not over yet!",
    "231107124_TextContext": "So that's how it is...",
    "231102072_TextContext": "I see... So you two are also looking for that guy...",
    "231102115_TextContext": "So that's your plan. Though alliance regulations prevent me from interfering with the business of the Astral Sanctuary...",
    "231104013_TextContext": "Oh, that...? I knew you were busy, so I felt like I shouldn't bother you.",
    "231101114_TextContext": "Let's go meet this Mr. Bai!",
    "231105132_TextContext": "Go! I'll clear a way for you!",
    "231103143_TextContext": "Got you...!",
    "231101079_TextContext": "What's the matter?",
    "231102066_TextContext": "The bombings in Area 88 are just an example. If we don't get this situation under control, things are just going to get worse.",
    "231106017_TextContext": "Old buzzkill... going on missions with you is so boring.",
    "231107100_TextContext": "Remember this point. The Scissors would never harm civilians.",
    "231106098_TextContext": "Only two mags...",
    "231106089_TextContext": "As long as you don't try anything suspicious...",
    "231103054_TextContext": "As long as you share what you know with us, of course.",
    "231101097_TextContext": "As long as there's a chance, our responsibility as doctors is to try and make a miracle happen.",
    "231102107_TextContext": "These bombings affect us, too.",
    "231101044_TextContext": "I can't let you shoulder this alone.",
    "231105092_TextContext": "Damn it... If this continues, we're done for!",
    "231103110_TextContext": "Where are we going to get that kind of weapon?",
    "231105136_TextContext": "What about you?!",
    "231107150_TextContext": "But, Kokona... what about my written apologies?",
    "231104130_TextContext": "But... we didn't come here for protection!",
    "231102063_TextContext": "But, the board's absurd energy rationing has completely disrupted our relief plans.",
    "231104174_TextContext": "It has to be! Navigator, you discovered the blind spot!",
    "231101093_TextContext": "Since we're a subsidiary, can't they offer us a discount?",
    "231102057_TextContext": "Listen carefully. My name is Audrey... Audrey Grove. Please don't forget it.",
    "231103154_TextContext": "Yahoooo! Long time no see, Celestia. How are you doing? You seem like you haven't been getting enough sleep.",
    "231103006_TextContext": "Uh... here, right? The Greenview Teahouse?",
    "231106076_TextContext": "Uhm, that's all I've got...",
    "231104094_TextContext": "Tell me, just who could instigate such a decorated P.U.S investigator to go against their duty?",
    "231105073_TextContext": "Whoaaa! There's so many of them!",
    "231107152_TextContext": "Hahaha... Kokona really hasn't changed at all.",
    "231105094_TextContext": "Haha! We've caught those P.U.S investigators in our trap, too.",
    "231107070_TextContext": "Hmpf! So you do recognize me!",
    "231101011_TextContext": "Zzz...",
    "231101024_TextContext": "Zzz...",
    "231105128_TextContext": "Zzz...",

    "231101018_TextContext": "Zzz... Zzz...",
    "231103026_TextContext": "Hum... Who would have thought that investigator Michele would encounter such a challenge on her first solo mission?",
    "231101051_TextContext": "Phew... It's finally over.",
    "231104082_TextContext": "You superstring beings are at least worth something to them, but people like me are just pawns that can be readily replaced.",
    "231106166_TextContext": "Guh...",
    "231107057_TextContext": "Ugh!",
    "231102681_TextContext": "Eh? What do you mean? Aren't you his...?",
    "231101112_TextContext": "Eh? Navigator? When did you call for a car? Wait a moment... where are we going?",
    "231101115_TextContext": "Eh? Eeeeeeh??",
    "231101076_TextContext": "Eh? W-What's...?",
    "231106014_TextContext": "When are we going to stop talking in riddles?",
    "231103031_TextContext": "Let's talk over breakfast!",
    "231105026_TextContext": "Ahem... It's nothing. I just met some interesting people, that's all.",
    "231103040_TextContext": "Ahem... Alright. Allow me to give you a proper introduction.",
    "231103033_TextContext": "Whoa! Kokona really has an eye for good food! You two should try some as well.",
    "231107113_TextContext": "AH! Not on my clothes!",
    "231104143_TextContext": "Ha... We can finally take a breather.",
    "231104008_TextContext": "Hahaha! It really has been a while, hasn't it?",
    "231104068_TextContext": "Ehehe... No, but it looks like I hit the mark. Tell me, which team were you on?",
    "231104148_TextContext": "Oi, you two. You can continue this conversation later.",
    "231105124_TextContext": "Oh dear... Celestia's really angry now. Our enemy better watch out...",
    "231104070_TextContext": "Pfft! It's fine if you don't tell me. I know several people who've left P.U.S. Compared to them, you're nothing special.",
    "231107151_TextContext": "Oh, let's not talk about such boring things! That guy isn't back anyway, so it's not like anyone's going to read it.",
    "231105075_TextContext": "Saving a permanent director of Urbino is gonna earn me so much cred! I wonder how many written apologies this will save me...",
    "231106063_TextContext": "In that case, let's have some fun.",
    "231106142_TextContext": "Just leave it to me!",
    "231103029_TextContext": "Oh! Just the two I was looking for.",
    "231104198_TextContext": "Oh? Looks like the Bureau of Investigation moves quickly...",
    "231101057_TextContext": "I have to do my best to protect them all.",
    "231103122_TextContext": "Hehehe! Taste the power of Mighty Meow, evil Scissors!",
    "231104112_TextContext": "Hmpf! It's not like I play games for nothing!",
    "231102061_TextContext": "Hmpf. That's enough chatter. Let's get to the point.",
    "231103055_TextContext": "Well... Since you're Kokona's friends, I guess it should be fine...",
    "231101070_TextContext": "Hmm... You're right! I'll get some rest first.",
    "231101022_TextContext": "Uuu... who...?",
    "231102034_TextContext": "Eh? Navigator, who was that you were talking to?",
    "231105142_TextContext": "Ah... The “last resort” has been used... What now, “Audrey?”",
    "231106086_TextContext": "Ahhhh, that's enough, that's enough. I have no idea what you're talking about.",
    "231107103_TextContext": "Gah! They ran away too...",
    "231102059_TextContext": "Ah! Are you the Lady Audrey who appeared in the latest episode of “30 Minutes?” One of the permanent directors of the Urbino Business Alliance?",
    "231103128_TextContext": "Ah! That was the one who planted the bomb! He ran into the back alley!",
    "231104171_TextContext": "Ah! Could it be?!",
    "231107145_TextContext": "Hey, are you guys done talking?",
    "231107120_TextContext": "Oh. It's Lady Audrey.",
    "231103050_TextContext": "Oh, whoops! There was a gag order on this... I wasn't supposed to say anything!",
    "231105090_TextContext": "Tch... Always using other people to do their dirty work. How detestable!",
    "231105066_TextContext": "Tch... I'll need to use the “last resort.”",
    "231104069_TextContext": "Tsk... I got tricked...",
    "231107086_TextContext": "Tsk... Communications are back online!",
    "231104072_TextContext": "...Dammit!",
    "231103127_TextContext": "Tsk. Useless fools... The “Great Awakening” is at hand... I can't allow myself to be captured here!",
    "231106183_TextContext": "Tch! Take this! Get away from them!",
    "231107171_TextContext": "Tch! Okay, okay, you're the boss.",
    "231106081_TextContext": "Tsk! The Scissors would never use ordinary people as shields!",
    "231106044_TextContext": "Tch. I know, I know.",
    "231106066_TextContext": "Tsk! These fools... there's no end to them.",
    "231106103_TextContext": "Tsk! What's with this guy?",
    "231107174_TextContext": "Oi... boss?",
    "231105088_TextContext": "Oi! Don't let them get away!",
    "231103099_TextContext": "Oi! I'm no match for them on my own! Stop hiding and help me!",
    "231102017_TextContext": "Oi.",
    "231107055_TextContext": "Hah!",
    "231103015_TextContext": "Mmm... One of my friends in P.U.S.",
    "231102044_TextContext": "Well... In any case, I got this guest pass.",
    "231102039_TextContext": "Mmm... I'm not sure if this counts.",
    "231103036_TextContext": "Ah. Seems like she still has a tooth for street food.",
    "231101099_TextContext": "You're right! So long as there's a glimmer of hope, I'll never give up on my patients!",
    "231104145_TextContext": "It was all thanks to Michele and Kokona... I'm sorry that we couldn't be of help.",
    "231104086_TextContext": "Navigator, do you see it too?",
    "231103068_TextContext": "Yes, I understand. That's why I asked for us to meet here.",
    "231107176_TextContext": "Aye. As you instructed, I broadcast the situation at Grove Bank to the Bureau of Investigation through the Urbino line.",
    "231106071_TextContext": "Eh? What's that sound?",
    "231102096_TextContext": "Mm? Navigator... is there something else?",
    "231101030_TextContext": "Shh... let her rest for a while.",
    "231103126_TextContext": "Hehe! Who are you praising? Me, or Mighty Meow?",

    "10105009_EventContent": "I discussed this with Yvette, our researcher, and she insists that it's impossible for robo battlecats to be conscious...",
    "10107001_EventContent": "I was having lunch with Yvette today, and she shared with me her latest experimental method.",
    "10504002_EventContent": "After I finished with the client this evening, I passed by a tavern where this piece was being played.",
    "10109005_EventContent": "Why don't you seek inspiration from other games?",
    "10506013_EventContent": "My purpose hasn't changed since we first met...",
    "10502005_EventContent": "We'll start with basic interaction!",
    "14601014_EventContent": "Judging from the results of our cooperation, the frequency of your string sequence is similar to that of mine. I believe that you'll make a fine navigator for me.",
    "10509014_EventContent": "One day, the unicorn disappears from the forest, leading to discussions by the other animals.",
    "10107012_EventContent": "From this perspective, protecting Bablo Crystals is the act of promoting the justice of PUS!",
    "10106002_EventContent": "He keeps asking others where his uniform and metal are. He keeps demanding to see his colleagues from the Sentinel Bureau!",
    "10106007_EventContent": "But he just won't listen... It's so frustrating!",
    "10106010_EventContent": "He was always like this, guarding the frontline day and night, never leaving his post without progressing the case.",
    "10503117_EventContent": "Off days are a luxury to me.",
    "10110013_EventContent": "Have you ever been to a cat café called Paw Pledge, partner?",
    "10106011_EventContent": "Partner, have you ever heard of The Burglar in Disguise, The Chainsaw Murderer, and The Mechanical Monster?",
    "10109008_EventContent": "You must be curious, partner, about why I'm writing a story for a game all of a sudden.",
    "10110001_EventContent": "There has been a major development regarding my game script, partner!",
    "10104006_EventContent": "The captain gave me a talking-to today, partner, because I didn't memorize the Investigator's Code of Conduct...",
    "10103002_EventContent": "Partner, I've just finished the latest episode of Paper Detective! What a twist...",
    "10108001_EventContent": "I need your help, partner!",
    "10109002_EventContent": "I'm writing my own video game script, partner.",
    "10107008_EventContent": "I wanted to share this article with you, partner.",

    "10508007_EventContent": "But when I close my eyes, no matter how hard I try, I just can't fall asleep... This has been going on for a long time now.",
    "10502002_EventContent": "But I feel that just reading the books doesn't quite cut it.",
    "10510005_EventContent": "But while organizing my violin scores today, I found a piece about this very story!",
    "14603009_EventContent": "After stringification, we're still the same, drawn to dreams with goals we wish to achieve.",
    "14610010_EventContent": "But I know that I must not give up, nor do I wish to. I must hold on until the day my star shines for me.",
    "10104011_EventContent": "However, the twenty-four articles of the Investigator's Code of Conduct... contain hundreds of words. I don't see how I can ever memorize all of them.",
    "14609007_EventContent": "I wonder if the ones lost at sea could feel the care and kindness in the lanterns.",
    "10503019_EventContent": "However, I'll still make time to contact my ally every now and then.",
    "10105002_EventContent": "It's chubby and cute, just like Mighty Meow!",
    "10109009_EventContent": "As a veteran gamer, I have played games of all genres other than the Superheroes of Justice series. But I've always felt that something was missing...",

    "10103021_EventContent": "Are you also interested? I'll send you the link, and we can both watch it!",
    "10106015_EventContent": "I know, right? Isn't he great?",
    "10101009_EventContent": "What kind of work do you do?",
    "14609015_EventContent": "What are your customs?",
    "14602010_EventContent": "You seem to know Astral Sanctuary quite well.",
    "10104004_EventContent": "Are you watching any new series?",
    "10501016_EventContent": "I'll write down the things you like and dislike, because, after all, we've signed a contract, and I would like to demonstrate my determination to you.",
    "10110104_EventContent": "Are you not interested in the good news?",
    "10506005_EventContent": "What do you think of you? What expectations do you have of our partnership?",
    "10109011_EventContent": "What kind of story is that?",
    "10103005_EventContent": "Now you've got me curious.",
    "10507002_EventContent": "Why do you want to know?",
    "10507009_EventContent": "Are you threatening me?",
    "10501013_EventContent": "Are you asking about my hobbies?",
    "10102014_EventContent": "It's not a problem if you're a rookie. I'll guide you through!",
    "10505013_EventContent": "Are you saying I can't even handle a cup of coffee?",
    "10102003_EventContent": "Do you have any hobbies? I can help you complete the survey as well.",
    "10107013_EventContent": "Your understanding of the matter has deepened!",
    "10102006_EventContent": "So do I! You have good taste in games, Navigator!",
    "10106003_EventContent": "Is your father ill?",
    "10507018_EventContent": "The dark circles under your eyes speak louder than words!",
    "10508002_EventContent": "Take a look at my schedule for the next couple of weeks. It's incredibly reasonable and healthy!",
    "10508017_EventContent": "Are you sure?",
    "10105008_EventContent": "Do you think... my robo battlecats have consciousnesses?",
    "14608005_EventContent": "Are you talking about「the sea」?",
    "14604010_EventContent": "That was a bit obscure...",
    "10108012_EventContent": "You did say you'd protect me...",
    "10510003_EventContent": "You told me that the story didn't have an ending...",
    "14601008_EventContent": "With the memory chip you gave me.",
    "10501105_EventContent": "No, that's not it... I can handle my work just fine.",
    "10506007_EventContent": "Let's just chat as friends!",
    "10110204_EventContent": "Hearing the good news first might make you feel better...",
    "14606004_EventContent": "They are all delicious desserts.",
    "14601011_EventContent": "My memory data is synchronized and stored in your brain through the memory chip.",
    "10510016_EventContent": "Regarding the ending of the story and the progress of our partnership...",
    "10109003_EventContent": "I have been thinking about a part of the plot, and I have no idea what to write...",
    "14602006_EventContent": "In fact, the coffee in question hasn't been very well-received among patients and other visitors...",
    "14606001_EventContent": "Actually, I've been trying Maddelena's method...",
    "14601007_EventContent": "If you don't mind - how do you do it?",
    "14602011_EventContent": "To be precise, I was the first healer and the only member at Astral Sanctuary.",
    "10103013_EventContent": "The culprit is the previously mentioned janitor. Having had low self-esteem since childhood, he also suffers from a hygiene-related OCD.",
    "14601004_EventContent": "I'm just getting started and not quite familiar with everything yet...",
    "14603001_EventContent": "Have you ever heard of The Era of Dreams, Navigator?",
    "14610001_EventContent": "Have you ever truly gazed at the starry sky, Navigator?",
    "14609001_EventContent": "Have you ever heard of the Lotus Lantern Festival of Strian, Navigator?",
    "14605001_EventContent": "Have you ever had sea salt cakes, Navigator?",
    "14607001_EventContent": "How have you been, Navigator?",
    "14610013_EventContent": "Would you like to accompany me to gaze at the stars on the beach, Navigator?",
    "14604004_EventContent": "Do Strinovians get injured or ill?",
    "14610003_EventContent": "Even among astronomers, there is a saying that goes, “There is a unique star for everyone, waiting alone in the universe, hoping to shine for you.”",
    "14608012_EventContent": "The history of the city is fascinating.",
    "10506011_EventContent": "So, you want to become closer friends with me...",
    "10505103_EventContent": "Oh, is it for me?",
    "10502017_EventContent": "I see... But I don't need to ask another question about you.",
    "14610014_EventContent": "To encounter a special kind of star...",
    "10103009_EventContent": "The victim is an arrogant and sloppy factory worker who looks down on everyone, never pays attention to hygiene, and often spoils the fruits of others' labor.",
    "14602003_EventContent": "Would you try the coffee the next time you visit, and let me know what you think of it?",
    "10506012_EventContent": "Am I right?",
    "10504007_EventContent": "Unfortunately for him, the girl he so admired fell in love with someone else...",
    "14607013_EventContent": "Should my soul start to disintegrate one day, please find me, retrieve me...",
    "14605004_EventContent": "Perhaps she added too much salt?",
    "10503002_EventContent": "Layers of paint were stacked on top of one another, and the lines were chaotic and complex.",
    "10104003_EventContent": "I've heard this three times already today...",
    "10508013_EventContent": "How about bedtime stories?",
    "10508019_EventContent": "Surely, listening to boring, childish fairy tales would put me to sleep fast, right?",
    "10504014_EventContent": "It's fun listening to you sharing all that!",
    "10105111_EventContent": "Hearing this makes me feel much better.",
    "14603006_EventContent": "My colleagues at Astral Sanctuary told me that the song celebrates dreams, spirited and impassioned.",
    "10507003_EventContent": "I heard it has something to do with treating collapse syndrome?",
    "10106013_EventContent": "Your dad sounds like quite the hero!",
    "14607010_EventContent": "They must be extremely lonely and helpless.",
    "10103018_EventContent": "Oops, sorry.",
    "10109106_EventContent": "Uh, just talking about reading makes me feel sleepy already...",
    "10105012_EventContent": "Speaking of which, you've been helping me taking care of them. As a result, they seem to be closer to you now.",
    "14602008_EventContent": "As a result, it's mostly consumed by our staff members, used as a stimulant for pulling all-nighters and overtime.",
    "10101005_EventContent": "Well, this was different...",
    "14610015_EventContent": "Wow! Is it a starfish?",
    "10103015_EventContent": "Wait a second. It's late already! Are you still with me, partner?",
    "10507020_EventContent": "Hmm...",
    "10510007_EventContent": "Hmm... The scores for the background music during our family tea parties.",
    "10105110_EventContent": "Hmm, if Yvette is right, I'd probably feel sad.",
    "10101010_EventContent": "Hmm, how do I explain it to you...",
    "10108013_EventContent": "Yes, yes, I did say that...",
    "10504012_EventContent": "Sorry, this is a serious topic...",
    "14609011_EventContent": "That's a heavy topic... It doesn't have to be so pessimistic.",
    "10105007_EventContent": "By the way, Navigator, I have a question for you...",
    "10503015_EventContent": "Sorry, I have a meeting to attend. Excuse me.",
    "10501014_EventContent": "Uh, yes... Isn't it normal for friends to know about one another's interests?",
    "10106004_EventContent": "Yes, he's shown symptoms of collapse syndrome earlier than expected and has been recuperating in a hospital in Elmond.",
    "10108009_EventContent": "Pawtector told me that the last time you visited me, you were followed by a couple of thugs.",
    "10107113_EventContent": "Yep, Michele, the Champion of Justice, has earned more experience!",
    "10103016_EventContent": "Yep, I'm here!",
    "10107015_EventContent": "Heh, while I get drowsy as soon as I open a book, I do make an effort.",
    "14603004_EventContent": "Because the band is popular.",
    "10509002_EventContent": "No animals dare to approach it due to its uniqueness.",
    "14608010_EventContent": "Because Strian was the first experiment for urban construction. Scientists and urban planners explored here schemes suitable for Strinovians.",
    "14603005_EventContent": "Because the song features a unique theme.",
    "14607006_EventContent": "Because, like its name, the gun is equally special. You might not know, Navigator, but outside Strinova, there exists a chaotic and discorded sea of illusions.",
    "10501010_EventContent": "During tea time, I do not check or reply to any messages.",
    "10108010_EventContent": "Before you realized it, they took down the baddies with ease!",
    "14609003_EventContent": "Many moons ago, the people of Strian mourned the departed during the Lotus Lantern Festival.",
    "10503013_EventContent": "In my opinion, the value of such artwork depends on how you interpret it.",
    "14610008_EventContent": "You may discover a unique light gazing at the sky on one of these nights. That's probably your star blinking at you.",
    "10503116_EventContent": "While I was at the exhibition, the client initiated a spontaneous meeting...",
    "14603014_EventContent": "Until we accomplish that, I hope to keep running Astral Sanctuary well, sheltering as many injured and vulnerable as possible.",
    "10110008_EventContent": "The bad news is... I found that each profession has its own specialty.",
    "10109006_EventContent": "Why don't you read some books on the subject?",
    "10105004_EventContent": "But it's a robo battlecat...",
    "10504011_EventContent": "Perhaps it was through unfulfilled longings and aspirations, enduring torment and pain, and the clash between ideals and reality that the composer wrote this piece.",
    "10503004_EventContent": "This must be art!",
    "10509015_EventContent": "The birds in the sky claim to have seen the unicorn leave the forest.",
    "10107002_EventContent": "She told me that her method could help advance medical research on collapse syndrome.",
    "10508005_EventContent": "Friends do not lie to one another!",
    "10110006_EventContent": "The good news is that the studio behind Superheroes of Justice held a press conference and announced the development of several sequels.",
    "10109018_EventContent": "Alright, I've got a plan! I'm going to keep working on it. I'll let you know when it's ready!",
    "10502019_EventContent": "Are you impressed? My attention to detail is undeniable!",
    "10503003_EventContent": "Without reading the description of the painting, no one could have guessed the artist's intended theme.",
    "10505007_EventContent": "Were I not stringified, I probably wouldn't be able to bear this sour and bitter flavor.",
    "14603010_EventContent": "If Strinova manages to fulfill the dreams of all, will dreams still exist?",
    "10509022_EventContent": "If it doesn't make the effort, it will never meet another unicorn.",
    "10501015_EventContent": "This helps us to better understand one another.",
    "10509017_EventContent": "The unicorn is determined to find the rest of its kind...",
    "10509018_EventContent": "Is it not the last unicorn?",
    "10105005_EventContent": "It should be renamed to Beckoning Meow!",
    "10509019_EventContent": "Does it find the rest of its kind in the end?",
    "14601006_EventContent": "Recording combat footage; getting involved with the daily life of the observed. This is a huge task...",
    "10104112_EventContent": "I know, right? Whose idea was this anyway?",
    "10510006_EventContent": "Violin scores?",
    "14604007_EventContent": "Just like back on Old Earth where the injured would go into shock from blood loss if not promptly treated, Strinovians have to tend their wounds.",
    "10108016_EventContent": "Just like everyone in my squad at work and my robo battlecats, you are all dear to me.",
    "10507010_EventContent": "I am threatening you!",
    "14604002_EventContent": "Try to avoid going to areas mentioned in the announcement. If you get injured, come see me at Astral Sanctuary on Star Street.",
    "10106008_EventContent": "Work must be important to him.",
    "10103010_EventContent": "His body is found in the factory workshop by the janitor.",
    "14605006_EventContent": "There are two methods to make cakes: baking and painting. The former is considered more nostalgic, while the latter contains more of the artistic sense of Strinova.",
    "10107017_EventContent": "Hopefully, the next time I chat with Yvette, I'll be able to pick up the conversation...",
    "14609008_EventContent": "I hope they do.",
    "14603016_EventContent": "I hope you'll be able to give me the answers I seek, Navigator, in a future where memories are rebooted.",
    "14608014_EventContent": "I hope you'll come to love Strian as much as I do.",
    "14608007_EventContent": "Not all cities here are modeled after Old Earth. For instance, Arton City, the capital of fashion, features an exaggerated style. Strian is probably the city with the most similar scenery to that of Old Earth.",
    "10501001_EventContent": "A pleasure to meet you.",
    "14602001_EventContent": "Could you do me a favor, Navigator?",
    "14604014_EventContent": "This is precisely what I've been doing, Navigator.",
    "14601001_EventContent": "Is everything alright with your recording work, Navigator?",
    "10506002_EventContent": "We've known one another for a while now, Navigator, haven't we?",
    "10507001_EventContent": "My assistant has sent you my schedule for the next three months, Navigator!",
    "10102001_EventContent": "PUS is conducting a survey on citizens' hobbies and interests, Navigator.",
    "10101006_EventContent": "That was control center's order, Navigator.",
    "10501002_EventContent": "Here is my contact information, Navigator.",
    "10101001_EventContent": "I am Investigator Michele of PUS. A pleasure to see you again, Navigator!",
    "10508018_EventContent": "O-Of course, I am! Don't get me wrong - I'm only doing this to fall asleep quickly.",
    "10103014_EventContent": "The victim is always mean to him, making a mess after the janitor has just finished cleaning. Over time...",
    "10102016_EventContent": "Of course. Put on the virtual reality device and you can start shooting. It's quite safe and convenient!",
    "10510012_EventContent": "Only then would you truly understand one another!",
    "10506017_EventContent": "It's more effective to talk face-to-face!",
    "10510018_EventContent": "As for the format... it will be neither a briefing session nor a debate, but in my - Audrey Grove's own way.",
    "10110015_EventContent": "Sounds mysterious!",
    "10103006_EventContent": "Tell me, who is the murderer?",
    "10502010_EventContent": "What is it?",
    "14601017_EventContent": "In any case, I look forward to our future cooperation, dear Navigator.",
    "14607002_EventContent": "With the sudden increase in the number of patients, I have personally felt the changes in the war.",
    "14605010_EventContent": "Are you saying they paint based on imagination? Is that how you end up with the flavor you desire?",
    "14608006_EventContent": "No, the sea I refer to is a landscape of Strinova, created by artists of Corridor based on the scenery of Old Earth.",
    "10110004_EventContent": "Tell me the bad news.",
    "10110003_EventContent": "Tell me the good news.",
    "14605008_EventContent": "They paint whatever pleases them!",
    "10510002_EventContent": "Would you like to know the ending of the unicorn story?",
    "10107014_EventContent": "And you sound more and more like a professional!",
    "10506006_EventContent": "That was way too formal...",
    "14602017_EventContent": "Thank you, Navigator. You as well.",
    "10507023_EventContent": "G-Got it...",
    "10103019_EventContent": "I just can't help but share with people every time I watch something I like...",
    "14602004_EventContent": "I don't really like coffee...",
    "10507022_EventContent": "I don't want my friend to be that exhausted...",
    "14602005_EventContent": "I'm not a professional coffee sommelier.",
    "10509020_EventContent": "I can't tell you because this story does not have an ending.",
    "10104012_EventContent": "I also happen to hate memorizing stuff.",
    "14601009_EventContent": "I'm not exactly sure either...",
    "10103007_EventContent": "Let's start from the beginning.",
    "14603013_EventContent": "At Urbino, we believe that dreams will continue to exist when the civilization and technology of the Strinovians reach significant advancement. We'll continue to pursue higher goals, a space of a higher dimension even...",
    "14609016_EventContent": "We celebrate past encounters and look forward to future reunions.",
    "10501003_EventContent": "Send me a friend request so we can contact one another later on.",
    "14604013_EventContent": "We figured out that strengthening the mental toughness of the wounded helps the wounds heal themselves; when their paper bodies are damaged, we help them through psychotherapy.",
    "14608003_EventContent": "Our city is one of life and ocean. There is a beach just behind Astral Sanctuary.",
    "14604009_EventContent": "We shed our flash, storing our consciousness in stringified paper-like bodies; weapons do not kill us. But if the crack is not sealed promptly, we will gradually lose consciousness until there is nothing left.",
    "14609009_EventContent": "We'll never know.",
    "10507016_EventContent": "The Grove family owes its long-lasting success to the fighting spirit that runs in our blood!",
    "10104008_EventContent": "Captain demands that we recite the PUS Admonitions and the twenty-four articles of the Investigator's Code of Conduct before work every day.",
    "10108007_EventContent": "Thank you! I promise it won't happen again!",
    "10505017_EventContent": "I will cherish it!",
    "14602012_EventContent": "I took in patients who had nowhere else to turn and the poor souls suffering from a fragile mind and unstable string sequences as a result of stringification.",
    "10501011_EventContent": "I make a nice cup of black tea and listen to music.",
    "10510017_EventContent": "I'll give you an answer.",
    "14607015_EventContent": "I'll always be there for you.",
    "10509006_EventContent": "I've just read you the beginning of the story.",
    "14605015_EventContent": "That was my attempt at making a joke... I hope it didn't come off as ill-mannered...",
    "14601016_EventContent": "I'm just a new navigator...",
    "10102012_EventContent": "I'm just a rookie. Do I have what it takes?",
    "10508004_EventContent": "Don't you forget - I am your navigator! You won't fool me!",
    "10501017_EventContent": "I am serious about this!",

    "14603003_EventContent": "I'm rather familiar with this kind of energetic pop music. What makes it so popular?",
    "10509011_EventContent": "All I want is to hear you read me a bedtime story!",
    "10105105_EventContent": "That's what I thought! Mighty Meow could look into new ventures!",
    "10510013_EventContent": "I look forward to meeting you!",
    "10508015_EventContent": "Let me think...",
    "10109016_EventContent": "Let me think...",
    "10507011_EventContent": "I'm looking out for you!",
    "10502001_EventContent": "I've been reading books on interpersonal relationships.",
    "10502018_EventContent": "Based on my intel, I've already deduced most of the details.",
    "10107016_EventContent": "I'll try my best to learn all there is to know about Bablo Crystals!",
    "10109017_EventContent": "I desire a story about heroes!",
    "10507111_EventContent": "I understand that your intentions are pure... But you might be overly anxious.",
    "10107007_EventContent": "My specialty is the guidance of memory paths.",
    "10507012_EventContent": "I've been doing well managing my health!",
    "10505010_EventContent": "No, I'm saying it's quite unique. I didn't know such a type of coffee with a taste this strong existed!",
    "10102010_EventContent": "I'm an alright player myself, Navigator. Would you like to play with me?",
    "10502013_EventContent": "I specialize in business negotiations, tea-tasting, and business analysis. I'm also somewhat knowledgeable in fields such as music, art, equestrianism, shooting, and dancing.",
    "10102002_EventContent": "I personally like watching TV series and playing video games.",
    "10105011_EventContent": "I believe they do.",
    "14604001_EventContent": "I read from the latest official announcement from PUS that the conflict has intensified. Please be careful, Navigator.",
    "10106108_EventContent": "My dad has always been a workaholic, to the point of feeling uncomfortable and restless when he's not at work.",
    "10105104_EventContent": "I think... Renaming Mighty Meow to BeckoningMighty Meow could be fun!",
    "14606005_EventContent": "I think I've mastered the painter's technique for making desserts. Maddelena calls it「dreams come true.」",
    "10504005_EventContent": "You need to brush up on your knowledge of music, ally!",
    "10510011_EventContent": "If I recall correctly, someone once told me that it had to be done face-to-face...",
    "10507004_EventContent": "I once suffered from collapse syndrome, yes... But that was many Strinovian years ago.",
    "10506004_EventContent": "My upcoming schedule is full again, so I can't arrange a face-to-face meeting with you. My apologies.",
    "10107114_EventContent": "Does that mean I have your approval, Navigator?",
    "10506010_EventContent": "I need to understand the pain points and difficulties in the development of our partnership and come up with iterative solutions to benefit the progress.",
    "10504009_EventContent": "So, he experienced heartbreak?",
    "10110010_EventContent": "Are you going to give up?",
    "10509016_EventContent": "All the animals make fun of the unicorn, for outside the forest is a desert, where the unicorn would surely starve to death.",
    "10102011_EventContent": "Can you improve your marksmanship by playing games?",
    "14604012_EventContent": "Sorry, that might have been too deep. In other words, we healers are like mechanics for the stringified paper-like bodies of Strinovians.",
    "14603015_EventContent": "Between a world of a higher dimension and The Second Collapse, I wonder which one will come first.",
    "10108003_EventContent": "Please, save Mighty Meow!",
    "14606010_EventContent": "According to her, before you start the actual cooking, you have to do it in your head first. In your imagination, every detail, including the color, taste, and texture, has to be as realistic as possible.",
    "10506003_EventContent": "According to the agreement, we ought to hold regular meetings to exchange our views of one another.",
    "10510008_EventContent": "According to the family tradition, tea is to be enjoyed with music.",
    "14608004_EventContent": "I'm a bit frightened of the sea...",
    "10110009_EventContent": "As an investigator, my specialty is catching criminals. I'll leave script writing to professional writers.",
    "10101016_EventContent": "I got it. As an investigator, I will protect you!",
    "10509007_EventContent": "What comes next?",
    "10509013_EventContent": "Well, it would be disappointing to stop a story halfway... Here comes the climax and the ending; listen carefully!",
    "14608009_EventContent": "But is Strian the way it is?",
    "14608011_EventContent": "The residents of Strian consider the city Paper Earth, insisting on reshaping everything based on Old Earth. Although we are Superstrings, a Terran heart beats in the core of the city.",
    "10510014_EventContent": "In that case...",
    "10103017_EventContent": "It seems like it's been a while...",
    "10503016_EventContent": "You were literally interpreting art just then...",
    "10106005_EventContent": "His doctor explicitly told him to focus on recovering and relax...",
    "10507006_EventContent": "Oh, trust me - there are issues!",
    "10509009_EventContent": "You're an adult, yet you're interested in a children's story!",
    "10101014_EventContent": "Understood, Investigator Michele!",
    "14610009_EventContent": "Astral Sanctuary was forced to close down once. Even now, our daily operations face a lot of pressure.",
    "10505004_EventContent": "This is the signature drink of Astral Sanctuary. Have some!",
    "14610011_EventContent": "Have you found your star yet?",
    "14606002_EventContent": "Last night, I dreamed of honey pancakes, almond puffs, lychee cream puffs...",
    "10504015_EventContent": "I-Is that so...",
    "10501005_EventContent": "Are you busy with work?",
    "10508009_EventContent": "Is it caused by work-related stress?",
    "14610016_EventContent": "Is it a painted star?",
    "10510004_EventContent": "Well, yes...",
    "14607011_EventContent": "Indeed, but the departed cannot be brought back... To prevent such tragedies from recurring, we carry their memories and wishes... We take up arms and cross dimensions in search of a sanctuary for our souls.",
    "10104105_EventContent": "Yep, Captain sure sounds like a broken record!",
    "10104005_EventContent": "Who's being a broken record?",
    "10505016_EventContent": "Plus, this is a gift...",
    "10110017_EventContent": "That's all I can tell you for now. I'll hit you up once I'm done with the written apology!",
    "14603008_EventContent": "Someone once said Strinova is the promised land where all the dreams of humanity can be realized.",
    "14602015_EventContent": "You better stop staying up late.",
    "14605014_EventContent": "You better not do anything so stupid...",
    "10507014_EventContent": "You've been frequently pulling all-nighters in the last three months!",
    "10102007_EventContent": "A police-themed shooter game was recently released. A lot of new investigators have improved their marksmanship by playing the game.",
    "10105006_EventContent": "Mighty Meow has accompanied me on a lot of missions; it must be exhausted. I should let it and Pawtector rest for a while.",
    "14602002_EventContent": "We're planning to introduce a new type of coffee for visitors while they are queuing.",
    "10503001_EventContent": "I saw a very abstract painting at the Leonardo da Vinci Museum recently.",
    "10110002_EventContent": "I have good news and bad news...",
    "10501004_EventContent": "Sometimes I'm too busy to reply to messages. But for you, I may make an exception...",
    "10102013_EventContent": "Well, you have the super gamer Michele with you! Don't you worry!",
    "14601002_EventContent": "Have you encountered any difficulties?",
    "10507021_EventContent": "Is it that obvious?",
    "10506107_EventContent": "Can friends not talk to one another like that?",
    "10502004_EventContent": "Let's do an exercise!",
    "10502003_EventContent": "I need field experience to find the right strategy for friend-making.",
    "14601010_EventContent": "Based on my understanding, the chip acts as a medium for our memories.",
    "10103011_EventContent": "According to the eyewitness, the victim gets scolded by his superior the day before the murder and, upon returning to his dormitory, threatens to kill his roommate after getting into an argument with the latter.",
    "14603011_EventContent": "I suppose they would.",
    "14603007_EventContent": "One of the lyrics goes, “All seekers are dreamers.” The song encourages people to pursue their dreams.",
    "10502006_EventContent": "Great minds think alike.",
    "10510010_EventContent": "Coincidentally... it's about time for the ally meeting!",
    "14601005_EventContent": "Every navigator has to go through a strict selection process. I'm sure you'll be fine.",
    "10501009_EventContent": "I have to check mountains of messages every day, so I've set a special “tea time” for myself.",
    "10507019_EventContent": "You doze off every time we go out!",
    "10504013_EventContent": "That's alright. I don't mind!",
    "10103004_EventContent": "Never could I have expected the murderer's motive to be...",
    "10109010_EventContent": "That no game has ever told the story that I want to experience!",
    "10110014_EventContent": "Never heard of it...",
    "14607009_EventContent": "The lost consciousnesses still have attachments and wishes, but none will ever respond to them.",
    "10108005_EventContent": "I'll take care of Mighty Meow!",
    "14606012_EventContent": "Then I ordered a desert delivery; that was much more efficient...",
    "14606007_EventContent": "And then...",
    "14602014_EventContent": "I was pulling all-nighters every other day, and that's probably when I picked up coffee.",
    "10507017_EventContent": "Staying up late is nothing... I'm full of energy now!",
    "10505003_EventContent": "I brought one for you. I hope you'll like it.",
    "14605002_EventContent": "Maddelena painted a sea salt cake for me; it was rather salty with hardly any sweetness...",
    "14605017_EventContent": "How does Maddelena do it? Let's ask her the next time we see her.",
    "14609012_EventContent": "With the war situation being relatively stable and the rapid development of paper body repair, the Lotus Lantern Festival has transformed into a holiday of reunion and care.",
    "10507005_EventContent": "Now, I strictly follow medical advice for rehabilitation and actively cooperate with your work. I don't think there are still any issues with my health.",
    "10108015_EventContent": "The situation has changed slightly... Because you, Navigator, are my partner in justice!",
    "10508003_EventContent": "Must you check on me daily? Do you now trust me at all?",
    "10506019_EventContent": "Can complex briefings be replaced with simple meetings?",
    "14605013_EventContent": "Paint a mountain of Dream Tokens!",
    "14605005_EventContent": "A painted cake is probably different from a baked one.",
    "14606014_EventContent": "Artists see everything differently than we do. Maddelena tells me they observe the shapes and lighting of objectives, memorizing them through extensive practice.",
    "14605007_EventContent": "I wonder how artists control the taste and flavor when painting desserts.",
    "14605003_EventContent": "The artist sure has a unique taste!",
    "10503014_EventContent": "The whimsy and emotions the painting represents; its artistic value and social significance; it all depends on the viewer's understanding and assessment...",
    "10503006_EventContent": "Indeed... Such artwork is usually extremely valuable.",
    "10509008_EventContent": "You...",
    "10506020_EventContent": "You excel at addressing complex issues with the simplest method, ally.",
    "10501012_EventContent": "What would you do during tea time, ally?",
    "10508012_EventContent": "Have you any ideas, ally?",
    "10502021_EventContent": "Are you still there, ally? Why aren't you replying?!",
    "10510001_EventContent": "I have made an exciting discovery, ally!",
    "10508001_EventContent": "I have been making an effort to rest, ally...",
    "10503007_EventContent": "You may not be able to imagine, ally...",
    "10505001_EventContent": "There is something I need to confirm with you, ally...",
    "10506001_EventContent": "There is something I need to confirm with you, ally...",
    "10510015_EventContent": "Come by my apartment when you have a moment, ally.",
    "10508011_EventContent": "The exact cause has yet to be determined... But more importantly, I have to overcome my insomnia and fall asleep quickly.",
    "14608013_EventContent": "What a magical and interesting place.",
    "10106009_EventContent": "I admire his sense of responsibility!",
    "10109001_EventContent": "I'm clueless. What should I write for the next part of the story...",
    "10504008_EventContent": "What a tragedy...",
    "10108006_EventContent": "Fine. I'll help you...",
    "10509111_EventContent": "Come on. You're acting like a kid...",
    "10505011_EventContent": "You don't have to finish it!",
    "14605012_EventContent": "Is it really that simple? The next time we're running low on funds at Astral Sanctuary, perhaps I could...",
    "10508008_EventContent": "My physician thinks I might be suffering from secondary insomnia.",
    "10102015_EventContent": "Just a second. Be right with you!",
    "10503009_EventContent": "After winning the bid, the buyer, in tears, said...",
    "10503012_EventContent": "It's got quite a deep meaning...",
    "14601012_EventContent": "I was a bit worried during the first memory connection...",
    "10504001_EventContent": "Piano Sonata No. 14...",
    "10501106_EventContent": "The campaign does consume a lot of my time.",
    "10104013_EventContent": "I'm sorry to hear that, Investigator Michele!",
    "14602007_EventContent": "Even after we made improvements to it, the guests still gave the feedback that it was too bitter and strong, making it hard for them to fall asleep at night.",
    "10109014_EventContent": "Do you not know the answer to that, either?",
    "14606009_EventContent": "Your dream will come true?",
    "10106001_EventContent": "My dad is such a workaholic... He hasn't even been discharged from the hospital, and he's been nagging at me, “Let me get back to work! I have to return to the frontline!”",
    "10106109_EventContent": "Dad would be very glad to hear that.",
    "10104015_EventContent": "Plus, I told you I'd protect you, didn't I? I won't be beaten by such a trivial matter.",
    "14607008_EventContent": "In the event of a complete collapse of consciousness, the souls of those Strinovians are forever trapped at sea, wandering in eternity.",
    "10107107_EventContent": "My specialty is arresting bad guys and upholding justice!",
    "14604011_EventContent": "Could you please explain it like I'm five?",
    "10110012_EventContent": "As for what it is exactly... Let's talk in person at a special location.",
    "10504010_EventContent": "Such things are unavoidable for an artist... Even the greatest of souls must experience hardship and mire.",
    "10503005_EventContent": "Art is always abstract...",
    "10504016_EventContent": "While I'm usually quite busy, I could make time for you if you're interested...",
    "10101008_EventContent": "Although the work can be repetitive and boring, I must fulfill my responsibilities as an investigator.",
    "10508014_EventContent": "Have you tried counting sheep?",
    "14610006_EventContent": "How do I find my star?",
    "10104113_EventContent": "If only Captain and former captain could be as understanding as you.",
    "10502215_EventContent": "Let me see if I missed anything...",
    "10110018_EventContent": "Let me see... I have finished three pages in three days. I need twelve more pages. That means I've finished... 20%.",
    "14602016_EventContent": "Take care of your body and mind.",
    "14606003_EventContent": "You're giving me the munchies...",
    "10107004_EventContent": "Between you and me, all this specialized knowledge is a bit out of my area of expertise... Are you familiar with this field, Navigator?",
    "14608002_EventContent": "Speaking of which, Navigator, have you had the chance to take a walk around Strian?",
    "10510009_EventContent": "Speaking of which, it's been a while since I attended a tea party!",
    "10108008_EventContent": "Speaking of which, they already see you as their partner in justice, Navigator!",
    "14607014_EventContent": "Do not leave me alone at sea, Navigator.",
    "14605016_EventContent": "Please don't take my joke seriously. Artists paint with Bablo Crystals, a highly regulated scarce mineral, not obtainable without prior permission.",
    "14607017_EventContent": "Thank you, Navigator.",
    "10508010_EventContent": "Stress only motivates me to work harder! I won't let it beat me!",
    "14609010_EventContent": "As a healer, I've witnessed countless instances of broken Superstrings and string sequence deterioration. All the strings end up flowing to the sea of illusions outside Strinova.",
    "14609004_EventContent": "Artists would paint all kinds of lotus lanterns by the beach and gather for a moment of praying and reflection, silently reciting the following...",
    "14604003_EventContent": "As the number of wounded continues to rise, we at Astral Sanctuary have been trying to recruit more personnel.",
    "10507024_EventContent": "Are you... looking out for me?",
    "10101004_EventContent": "That was quite official!",
    "10507013_EventContent": "I'm quite confident about that!",
    "10104104_EventContent": "That's not a line from the new show; it's Captain's catchphrase!",
    "10103023_EventContent": "Hold your horses... You can spoil the show from the very beginning.",
    "14603012_EventContent": "It's hard to say.",
    "10503011_EventContent": "Wow, cringe alert!",
    "10105010_EventContent": "That would make them quite lonely.",
    "10106012_EventContent": "My dad personally dealt with their cases and arrested every single one of them!",
    "10107006_EventContent": "It's outside my area of expertise as well.",
    "10102009_EventContent": "This is a rare opportunity for gamers to challenge one another!",
    "10506009_EventContent": "This method is widely used in business meetings. It helps both parties quickly understand one another and deduce ways for improvement and optimization.",
    "14606011_EventContent": "That's a bit hard for me... I actually woke up from hunger while dreaming last night...",
    "14607012_EventContent": "This is why I fight; this is what Urbino believes in.",
    "14606013_EventContent": "This is what separates ordinary folks from artists.",
    "10503008_EventContent": "This painting fetched an unbelievable price at the auction.",
    "14607004_EventContent": "It seems too watery!",
    "10509005_EventContent": "This is a bedtime story about the last unicorn.",
    "10504003_EventContent": "What kind of piece is it?",
    "10502115_EventContent": "So the other party can get to know you better!",
    "10509004_EventContent": "What is it?",
    "14603002_EventContent": "It's the new song by Dream Chasers, a band from Arton City, and it's achieved the number one spot on the Strinova Singles Chart.",
    "10505104_EventContent": "I see. It's got a unique name.",
    "14606015_EventContent": "That being said, traditional cooking techniques might suit me better...",
    "14605011_EventContent": "Does that mean we won't have to research recipes when we make improvements to our Starlight Coffee at Astral Sanctuary? We can simply paint the kind of coffee we want.",
    "14607007_EventContent": "The sea gathers the consciousness and string sequences of Strinovian. If there are wounds on their paper bodies, the lost string sequences and consciousness flow to the sea like a river of hurt.",
    "10505006_EventContent": "The taste of the coffee is rather “special”... It's almost the raw flavor of coffee beans tasting of unprocessed sourness and bitterness!",
    "10506008_EventContent": "You may not be used to my briefing method.",
    "10507110_EventContent": "Stop bluffing! What evidence have you got?",
    "10505002_EventContent": "Did you send me this box of ver.23.8.19.62 Starlight Coffee?",
    "10506016_EventContent": "Is remote briefing not feasible?",
    "14607005_EventContent": "Through it, I feel the surging of the deep sea.",
    "14604006_EventContent": "Normally, wounds are only caused by dimensional oscillation bullets on the battlefield.",
    "14610012_EventContent": "That... is a secret.",
    "14607016_EventContent": "That day will not come.",
    "10110019_EventContent": "You're the only person I want to take to that place... We'll see each other soon; I promise.",
    "10506021_EventContent": "In that case... I'll check my schedule later.",
    "10110007_EventContent": "I'm sure one of them will tell the story I've always wanted.",
    "10505008_EventContent": "Is it that bad?",
    "10506014_EventContent": "Then let's find the time to meet in person!",
    "10101015_EventContent": "I'll leave it to you then.",
    "10502007_EventContent": "Allow me to provide a topic for discussion!",
    "14602013_EventContent": "From administration to treatment and logistics, I managed everything as if I were a one-man army. It was both exhausting and fulfilling.",
    "10103008_EventContent": "It's a locked-room mystery taking place at a factory in Preton.",
    "10504006_EventContent": "It's a piece filled with tenderness and sorrow yet not lacking in firmness and passion. I heard a great composer of the Old Earth dedicated it to the person he loved.",
    "10110016_EventContent": "That place is my secret base!",
    "14610005_EventContent": "Will my star keep waiting for me?",
    "10502016_EventContent": "The most important thing is asking about the other party!",
    "10101007_EventContent": "My superiors are concerned about whether we have fulfilled our civilian-related duties.",
    "14609006_EventContent": "Then, they'd write the names of the deceased on the lotus lanterns before releasing them into the sky.",
    "14605009_EventContent": "They paint the taste they expect.",
    "10107003_EventContent": "Firstly, they have to make a breakthrough on the purification limit of Bablo Crystals. Then, they have to solve the issue of transforming Bablo Crystals from a superposition to an eigenstate...",
    "10103012_EventContent": "(You patiently listen to Michele's analysis of the plot for an hour...)"

Celestia mulled over how to respond.\nChildren cannot understand the complexities of collapse syndrome, but they can see its effects on people. Someone they know will suddenly change in temperament, become argumentative, and start having endless quarrels, frictions, and conflicts with their relatives - a once-happy family completely destroyed.\nIn the face of the child's personal pain, it felt as if any words she could speak would be powerless to heal his wounds.\nCelestia didn't have a response. She knew that his parents were still alive, but with the affliction of collapse syndrome, they might as well have been different people. What would happen to the children left behind? What would be their future?\nShe would do her best to calm the mind of the young ones under her care. As she gazed upon their young sleeping faces, she imagined that she could heal the scars deep within their minds, bit by bit.\nUrbino's funding solved her financial issues, but Celestia still lacked reliable partners. Her only choice was to take on more and more work. Early days and long nights became commonplace. To keep herself awake, Celestia came up with a brew she called Starlight Coffee. The bittersweet and refreshing drink became one of her daily little pleasures.\nThe Astral Sanctuary has gradually earned a reputation. Those who have received her care will never forget Celestia. But she remained alone.\nAt least, until the Navigator came into her life...\nPerhaps Celestia, regarded as a “star” by her patients, will finally receive a “star” of her own?",

But she had never given much thought to the purpose of her designs. Kokona resolved to find a task befitting of Mister Sea Bunny.\nHis light frame provided excellent aerodynamics. He had a wide field of vision. His small size meant he could squeeze through gaps and navigate difficult terrain. The most suitable task would be...\n“Arrrrgh! I've got nothing!!” Kokona scratched her head in distress as she paced through camP.U.S.\nAttention drawn by the ruckus, a girl slightly younger than Kokona popped her head around the corner. “Excuse me - is there something bothering you?”\nPerhaps she just needed someone to vent to. Kokona wasn't expecting much. Nevertheless, she painstakingly repeated the story of her assignment and Mister Sea Bunny's past and present life.\n“If that's the case, why don't you just ask him? If he could choose, what would Mister Sea Bunny like to do?”\nBefore she could say anything else, the girl was quickly called away by an older woman bearing the uniform of a P.U.S executive.\nKokona can still clearly recall the brilliant starry pattern on that girl's dress, along with her carefree advice.",

But all this meant was that what happened was even more of a surprise.\nThe company's executive director was assassinated, her parents' safety was threatened, and the company entered a deep crisis.\nIn a calculated strike, Blaise's faction in the family defected en masse, selling their stocks to competitors at discount prices, resulting in huge losses to the family's position.\nWhen Audrey and her father attempted to take charge of the situation and rally the family, their speeches were met with ridicule and blank stares. Having seized control of the narrative, their opponents called for a vote and ruthlessly expelled father and daughter from the family.\nThe sudden betrayal made Audrey raise her defenses even higher. She could trust no one but her parents.\nTo preserve what remained of the family's business, Audrey announced that she would be delisting the company as she explored new avenues.\nNow a house divided, the outside world sees the sun setting on the Grove family. But Audrey knows that a true Grove stands proud and unyielding, pure and eternal.",

He even short-circuits when I put him in water...”\n“Please wait a moment, Kokona.” The admissions officer tried collecting themselves from the girl's long-winded rant.\n“We already know that you have great affection for this... housekeeping bot. We do appreciate your interest in robotics, but I feel obliged to say that we won't be able to admit you based on just that.”\n“Don't worry! Don't worry! There's more to my story. After that, I dismantled Mister Sea Bunny down to his core components!”\n“You're saying you managed to disassemble a robot at such a young age? Impressive, but I'll need to hear more.”\n“What if I told you I put him back together? Check it out! Doesn't he look more like a sea bunny now?”\n“Hm. Not bad for a student. But there's a fatal flaw.”\nFaced with Kokona's blank expression, the admissions officer let out a sigh.\n“Listen carefully. What you have now is just an empty shell with a cute face. Kokona, machines should also have their own souls.”\nKokona let out a slight frown of dejection. She had never thought about this.\nThe admissions officer was right. She had turned Mister Sea Bunny into nothing more than a sophisticated toy.\nShe wasn't looking forward to telling her parents about this rejection...\n...\n“Your first piece of homework will be finding him a soul.”\n“Eh?

Love, mom and dad.”\nKokona always received a letter and gift from her far-away parents for her birthday. The contents would vary greatly from year to year, from strange dolls to exquisite fabrics... Every time Kokona was about to open a gift, she would make a guess and comment on what she received during the next video call. It was the special little ritual of her family.\nKokona would have never been able to guess what she received this time - a round, barrel-shaped housekeeping bot.\nThough she'd seen all manner of strange antiques and artifacts, this was the first time Kokona had come into contact with such advanced technology.\nBoasting a simple design, powerful, cutting-edge materials, and the power of AI, these bots gave Kokona an entirely new sense of wonder.\nWhen she pressed the power button, the sensor on the top of the bot would spin around like a pair of rabbit ears.\n“Mister Robot, are you a rabbit? What's up with the pair of long ears?”\n“Correction. The 'antennas' on this device are biosensors designed to imitate those on sea bunnies.”\n“So... You're not a rabbit? Should I call you Mister Sea Bunny?”\n“Unknown command. Owner may be attempting to register 'Mister Sea Bunny' as the username of this machine. Please confirm.”\n“I don't get it...

Playing games sat in front of the television is one of the few moments the father can spend with her daughter.\nGeorge controls Mighty Meow, the protagonist, while Michele takes his partner, Pawtector. Together, the duo takes on the evil dragon.\nIt takes courage and innovation to beat a game as fast as possible.

Michele's father took urgent steps with a grave look on his face.\nIt was the first time that he hadn't promised a day in which he would return. As the pitter-patter of monsoon season enveloped Elmond, there was an eerie lack of news about Michele's father.\nAfter an uncountable number of days, the rain gradually died down, and Michele finally received a call from the Sentinel Bureau. The voice on the phone spoke about how someone had brought great harm to her father - he had fallen victim to the dreaded collapse syndrome. Immediately after, all of his duties were suspended.\nMichele has always held firm in the belief that her father was relieved from his duties because of injury, but that didn't mean she didn't hear the constant flurry of rumors.\nIn Superheroes of Justice, the heroes are wounded before they can achieve justice - just as her father was during his mission.\nThrough the glass window of the hospital ward, Michele kept her watch day after day, but her father showed no sign of improving.\nOn the face of the girl who had always been so full of energy and sunshine, raindrops began to form.",

Lawine knew that she would no longer be able to draw her blade for P.U.S.\nLawine and Meredith concluded that the public had to know the truth, but P.U.S executives had grown wise to what was going on. A group of assassins was already heading their way.\nAmid her escape, Lawine came face-to-face with her partner once more - this time as enemies.\nTo Lawine's surprise, her partner showed no hesitation. A gunshot sounded, and as a cold bullet shattered Lawine's blade, the warm thread of their friendship was abruptly severed.\nOfficially branded as a defector, Lawine moved to the edges of society. With Meredith's help, she came into contact with an organization known as The Scissors.\nCasting away her original name, she blended into the night.

She had passed, and he even brought her a gift to celebrate - two robo battlecats.\nThe battlecats, once her father's recon bots, had been upgraded to serve as tactical bots for Michele. She quickly gave them appropriate names: “Mighty Meow” and “Pawtector.”\nInspired by her favorite game, Michele's bold and unexpected antics quickly built her a reputation amongst her peers. Her “gamer's attitude” made her stick out like a sore thumb, and she was often reprimanded and ostracized for violating discipline.\n“So much for being a hero's daughter...”\n“Undisciplined investigators are an embarrassment!”\nThese voices of doubt and scorn surrounded Michele, planting a small seed of insecurity in the new investigator's heart.",

They all seemed based on criminals that her father had brought to justice.\nOn a fateful afternoon, Michele was surfing the Superheroes of Justice forums for help on a particularly tricky level when she happened upon a post discussing the inspiration behind one of the protagonists, Big Meow.\nThe post gave a rigorous argument as to why the inspiration behind Big Meow was George Lee, an investigator with countless tricky cases under his belt.

She wanted to create that same expression in others.\nThe Learys were a stern couple. Maddelena and her sister Galatea were required to spend every day in grueling practice, from six in the morning to nine at night.\nAs her palette grew more and more colorful, Maddelena's face and palms often became stained with paint, and the girl started to resemble a shabby cat.\nUnlike Maddelena, her sister grew dissatisfied with their planned-out lives.

    "14603012_TextContext": "Someone's got a high opinion of themselves!!",
    "15146068_TextContext": "I seem to have heard your precious laughter. Turns out that the light I've been chasing all this time... was you.",
    "9601011_TextContext": "Just to be safe, I took you back to my clinic to get some rest.",
    "14603013_TextContext": "...I'm not sure why, but your words feel like starlight piercing through the clouds, shining itself on me.",
    "14605007_TextContext": "But... I'm...",
    "14602011_TextContext": "But I'm not as confident it will suit anyone else's taste.",
    "10101011_TextContext": "But that's the person I am. I aspire to be a gamer-style investigator!",
    "9820028_TextContext": "I've got a gift for you. As a show of thanks.",
    "10501018_TextContext": "Y-You could be a friend of the Groves...",
    "15146205_TextContext": "You're also interested in rescue missions?\nI know you mean well, but I'm sorry... I have to do these things myself.",
    "15101205_TextContext": "It's impossible to resist teasing it, right? Here, you try!",
    "10501023_TextContext": "You didn't sound like a friend...",
    "15146055_TextContext": "You've got mail. Could it be something important? Best not wait! Let's open it up and take a look!",
    "15105002_TextContext": "Are you really... that strong?\n(Cough) What I meant was that I wanted to recognize your abilities.\nIs my praise not worthy of your happiness?",
    "15146067_TextContext": "You must be tired. Come here and rest for a while. I can help you work out the next battle plan...\nZzz...",
    "15105022_TextContext": "Hard to believe the Grove family experienced such internal strife, isn't it?\nBut as one who has lived through it, I'm acutely aware of the twists and turns of our family history.",
    "15105023_TextContext": "Want to partner up?\nYou'll find that I have exacting standards for those who work with me.",
    "10501012_TextContext": "You want me as your business partner?",
    "9601012_TextContext": "Who...?",
    "15146114_TextContext": "Trying to praise me?\n...Thank you.",
    "9820004_TextContext": "And you are?",
    "14602001_TextContext": "You're here! Just give me a moment. Things are a bit messy...",
    "15146203_TextContext": "Oh, you're here?! Give me a moment. I just need to check what sort of rescue quests we have available right now.",
    "10501016_TextContext": "I find your attitude... somewhat unexpected. The Grove family is reputable and respected in both the business and finance sectors. I don't see a single reason why you would say no.",
    "14602020_TextContext": "Your expression... seems rather heavy.",
    "15105103_TextContext": "Would you like a cup of black tea? I brewed it myself.\nOf course, if you'd rather not drink, that's fine with me. Hmph!",
    "14603035_TextContext": "Look like we got a little more luck.",
    "14602009_TextContext": "Why don't you give it a try? This is my first attempt at making jam.",
    "14604041_TextContext": "To be honest, I don't know that much about Meredith, so I was hoping you could give me some ideas.",
    "14602034_TextContext": "Actually, I made a few other flavors too...",
    "14601030_TextContext": "There seems to be something broken in your heart...",
    "14601024_TextContext": "Just hold on a little longer. I'll be done in no time.",
    "10101002_TextContext": "Let me introduce myself again. My name is Michele. My hobbies are cats and video games...",
    "10501030_TextContext": "I would like to reiterate that the friendship I desire is one that's long-lasting and stable. You will be my most valuable ally. Your wishes and demands will also be respected to the greatest extent possible as reflected in the contract.",
    "14603023_TextContext": "I'm not gonna be able to keep a straight face if we keep this up.",
    "9602001_TextContext": "Are you ready Navigator?",
    "15146058_TextContext": "At that moment, I had a new goal. I want to be someone you can rely on. If you can assist me in this, I dare say we'll be able to help each other in times to come.",
    "15146207_TextContext": "Even in a place like this, Strinova, often described as an idyllic homeland for humanity, there are so many who suffer in poverty. It's my duty to do something for them, no matter how small that “something” may be.",
    "15101010_TextContext": "I never would've guessed you knew me so well. Truth be told, I never expected to receive such an extraordinary gift. I must thank you...",
    "10101020_TextContext": "I was slightly worried that you might not be into video games...",
    "10501026_TextContext": "So that's what you want!",
    "14601005_TextContext": "I was getting antsy anyway!",
    "14604022_TextContext": "Just saying “thank you” lacks sincerity, so I want to get a gift for everyone!",
    "15101020_TextContext": "Only when all battles have ended will I finally be able to game to my heart's content, right?",
    "15101204_TextContext": "As long as I'm home, my cat seems extra energetic!",
    "15146054_TextContext": "It'll take all of us working together to put fear into the enemy's heart! We can do this!",
    "10501017_TextContext": "Darn it. I have never failed a business negotiation... Are you sure you don't want to reconsider? I'm hoping that...",
    "14605036_TextContext": "Regret, guilt, self-blame... I lose track of time and end up only getting a little sleep.",
    "14605025_TextContext": "Sob... I feel so ashamed...",
    "15101003_TextContext": "All my troubles are gone.",
    "14605024_TextContext": "Wha! How could this happen?! Such laziness... such carelessness and irresponsibility!",
    "9603001_TextContext": "Phew... So, this is what a consciousness link feels like.",
    "15101104_TextContext": "Wow, that was a really cool anime episode!",
    "14605013_TextContext": "Hehe. That's probably it. We just saw each other yesterday!",
    "10101006_TextContext": "You don't know, do you? That must be what it means to hide one's light under a bushel.",
    "14603020_TextContext": "Take as much as you want. There's plenty more where it came from!",
    "15105024_TextContext": "Hmpf! This is just typical for you, isn't it? Being rude like that!",
    "15101013_TextContext": "Eh? Did you write something on my hand?\nIs this some kind of text-based game?",
    "14604006_TextContext": "Waah. It's a pity that I'm busy with the Astral Sanctuary. I would have liked to give it a try...",
    "14605046_TextContext": "Mmm... It's a bit noisy... but... peaceful...",
    "14605038_TextContext": "Ehm... I just stood up too quickly. The blood rushed to my head...",
    "14605008_TextContext": "Ehm. Forget it... You've already seen me like this anyway...",
    "14605029_TextContext": "Ah, well... The important thing is to get in contact with everyone and head to the Astral Sanctuary. A lot of work must have piled up in my absence!",
    "10501019_TextContext": "Business cooperation is not in my area of expertise.",
    "9604003_TextContext": "Ahahaha...",
    "14601022_TextContext": "AHHH! Don't touch there!!!",
    "9820006_TextContext": "Ah! I forgot to introduce myself.",
    "14601008_TextContext": "Ah... Maybe I said too much...",
    "15101206_TextContext": "Nyaa! Cute outfit? Right?!",
    "14601015_TextContext": "Ah. You haven't really given it much thought until now, am I right?",
    "14605035_TextContext": "Um... When I'm alone, my mind tends to wander to all kinds of complicated feelings...",
    "15101005_TextContext": "Hmm... another new piece of mail. Let's see what's inside!",
    "14604044_TextContext": "Ah. So that's the kind of stuff that Meredith likes. I've got it!",
    "14601026_TextContext": "That's more like it. Good job. I'm done now.",
    "14602014_TextContext": "Be my guest!",
    "14603036_TextContext": "Mhmm! Today turned out to be an unexpected success.",
    "9602003_TextContext": "Mhm. I'm sure you'll ace the inspection.",
    "15146112_TextContext": "Hm? Is something the matter?\nDon't be shy about asking me for help if you want it.",
    "14605031_TextContext": "Eh? Did I miss something?",
    "10101004_TextContext": "Heh, you would never guess it in a hundred years, but that person is actually...",
    "14605020_TextContext": "I wanted to think more about the Astral Sanctuary and my mother, so I tried to create a quiet environment for myself...",
    "14602024_TextContext": "It's just that I put a lot into making this jam. That's why I'm eager for some feedback.",
    "14605010_TextContext": "I'm worried about you!",
    "14601014_TextContext": "That's why most people sign up for a check-up after they've been in Strinova for a while.",
    "15146064_TextContext": "Quest completed.",
    "9820014_TextContext": "In my view, Navigators deserve a lot of respect.",
    "9601018_TextContext": "To me, you've always been more like my senior - a peer.",
    "9601002_TextContext": "I've chosen my future in this lost expanse.",
    "14601025_TextContext": "H-Holding on...",
    "10501011_TextContext": "Based on our previous cooperation, I am interested in establishing a long-term partnership with you. Together, we will be unstoppable!",
    "14604021_TextContext": "Thanks to everyone's help, the Astral Sanctuary isn't in danger anymore.",
    "15105009_TextContext": "It's all thanks to you.\nDon't give me that look. I know when to thank you, and I'll say it clearly!\n",
    "14603039_TextContext": "It's probably because of a “certain someone!”",
    "10501007_TextContext": "With the election fast approaching, the Grove family shall become the leader of the business world for the next decade.",
    "14603034_TextContext": "The forecast was a total mess!",
    "14604057_TextContext": "That's great! Next time... let's go to an art exhibition together!",
    "9601007_TextContext": "Thank goodness! You're awake...!",
    "14602033_TextContext": "That's great! What a load off my mind...",
    "14602025_TextContext": "But if I'm too anxious, I'll be putting pressure on you too.",
    "9820016_TextContext": "To lose one's memory is to lose one's self. Only by relying on Navigators like you can people find themselves once more.",
    "10101022_TextContext": "It's been a while since I played videos with other people at home. Do you think an adventure involving both an investigator and a navigator would be particularly interesting?",
    "14605027_TextContext": "Okay! I've updated everyone on the situation.",
    "14602002_TextContext": "So many apples!!",
    "14605026_TextContext": "Alright. I've sent a message to the group chat.",
    "15105021_TextContext": "I'd describe us as traveling companions now, but I'd much rather wish we were more!\nOnly feelings that have survived the crucible of adversity can stand the test of time.",
    "9820019_TextContext": "If the day comes when I'm “reincarnated,” please make sure to transfer my memory back and help guide me... so that I can become Celestia once more.",
    "10501006_TextContext": "If one were to compare the entire business world to a giant cruise ship, the leader would be the person steering the ship and determining its course.",
    "15146120_TextContext": "If only these stars could be given to those who truly needed them, in the Astral Sanctuary. It does bring a modicum of hope to their lives. You'd be happy too, won't you?",
    "15146053_TextContext": "I'm really sorry.",
    "15105020_TextContext": "My family's legacy teaches that we must look toward the future.\nOnly then, can we endure.",
    "15105012_TextContext": "By the way, there's something I forgot to tell you.\nYou have no right to look into my history without my express permission!\nIn any case, I know nothing about what will happen...",
    "14605032_TextContext": "That's right! We've gotta recharge the communicator right away!",
    "15101011_TextContext": "I am very curious, particularly about anything to do with you!\nAre you sure there's nothing you wanna tell me in confidence?",
    "14603027_TextContext": "Just like your existence?",
    "14604020_TextContext": "It's that store right ahead!",
    "15101024_TextContext": "I can sympathize with Scissors feeling like their backs are up against the wall, but that doesn't justify their extreme methods...\nAnyway, I can't understand it.",
    "9604004_TextContext": "Even someone like me... has a reason to fight.",
    "14601009_TextContext": "I almost forgot about the task at hand!",
    "9604007_TextContext": "I hope that your gentleness can protect those around you, Navigator.",
    "9601017_TextContext": "They help stabilize our mental state and allow us to find ourselves once more. To help protect against collapse syndrome.",
    "14604003_TextContext": "Strian's always like this. It is a famous resort, after all!",
    "10501003_TextContext": "The pleasure is mine!",
    "14604013_TextContext": "Fantasizing...? It's times like these where I don't have a clue what's going through your mind.",
    "9601019_TextContext": "The Navigator is a great doctor whom everyone respects.",
    "10101001_TextContext": "You're here, Navigator. Welcome!",
    "10501010_TextContext": "Become a friend of the Grove family, Navigator!",
    "10101012_TextContext": "In our rare free time, Navigator, are you interested in a challenge between gamers?",
    "9820012_TextContext": "Navigator?",
    "14601013_TextContext": "Though adverse reactions to stringification are rare, they're still a concern.",
    "14605011_TextContext": "I wanted to see you, obviously!",
    "14604004_TextContext": "Of course, the main reason is the beach volleyball competition held by the bay. It's been going on all week.",
    "14602006_TextContext": "Of course, there's some for you too. That's why I invited you over!",
    "9820029_TextContext": "From now on, my memory is in your hands.",
    "14604055_TextContext": "I'm happy you're willing to appreciate this kind of stuff with me...",
    "14604032_TextContext": "As for Kokona... Oh? I didn't expect to find this here!",
    "14601032_TextContext": "Ah! You must be hungry!",
    "15105005_TextContext": "Don't forget to check your mail.\nIf it were anyone other than you, I would not take such great pains to remind you of this!",
    "15105003_TextContext": "Ehm... I'm not good at comforting others... Hey you, how do you want to console yourself?\nWould you prefer a pat on the shoulder or your head?\n",
    "14602017_TextContext": "How's it going?",
    "15105206_TextContext": "What? Do you not understand what I'm saying?\nCome and sing with me!",
    "14604014_TextContext": "Then again, I also get the feeling that it's a blessing I don't know what you're thinking right now...",
    "14605012_TextContext": "I feel as if we haven't seen each other in a while... am I just overthinking things?",
    "9820008_TextContext": "As I'm sure you know, Urbino provides funding to members who run public welfare organizations.",
    "9604005_TextContext": "You'll understand eventually.",
    "14601012_TextContext": "You're still a newcomer to Strinova, right?",
    "14601027_TextContext": "You're the picture of health!",
    "9820001_TextContext": "You're awake?",
    "9601021_TextContext": "You'll need to use a memory chip to link with me and record all my actions.",
    "15146406_TextContext": "Want to fold some stars up with me?\nBut before that, we might want to figure out what kind of wish we'd like to make.",
    "9602004_TextContext": "Link established. Starting the inspection.",
    "15105203_TextContext": "Wha?! I wasn't secretly listening to rock!\nI can't believe you would suddenly show up out-of-the-blue without saying something first...\n",
    "14605047_TextContext": "I'll... take a break... for a while...",
    "9601003_TextContext": "I've never forgotten what you said.",
    "15146108_TextContext": "I won't hide anything from you, but... why are you touching that place? I'm not quite sure how to describe my feelings on the topic, and even less on what they mean...",
    "15101012_TextContext": "I'm not a little kid anymore! Hehehe!",
    "15101026_TextContext": "I've never regarded naivety as a personal fault. Perhaps behind those willful dreams, there really is a world in which everyone would like to live.",
    "15146059_TextContext": "It's been a while, hasn't it? Each day apart feels like three autumns of longing. An eternity of separation... Please, could you not stay away for so long next time? I've really grown used to you staying by my side.",
    "9601014_TextContext": "We arranged a Mindlock Inspection today to check and record my conditions.",
    "9820022_TextContext": "I'll perform my duties as a Navigator.",
    "15105106_TextContext": "I didn't come here on purpose. I'm just curious about what you've been working on.",
    "14602022_TextContext": "I'm... tasting... carefully...",
    "14605005_TextContext": "I'm home... You're being too loud. The neighbors are going to complain...",
    "9820010_TextContext": "I was one of the first on the scene after receiving the rescue mission from Area 88 and found you lying on the pavement.",
    "15105027_TextContext": "I don't deny the possibility of betrayal still exists, but if it were to be you, perhaps I could accept that...\nHmpf! You don't seem like you'd dare betray my trust anyway!",
    "15105011_TextContext": "The only reason I'm still here is to keep a better eye on that which concerns me. It wasn't all for you!",
    "14604053_TextContext": "I'm a huge fan of modern art, but mother likes the classics much more.",
    "15101028_TextContext": "I always felt like I had some kind of special calling in life... Like curing Collapse Syndrome, fighting off The Scissors, and stuff...\nI'm not joking! I'm being serious!",
    "14604039_TextContext": "I'm sure that Kokona will be able to feel your thanks...",
    "10501013_TextContext": "The relationship I would like to establish is more than just business...",
    "15105001_TextContext": "This type of victory doesn't satisfy you, am I right?\nWhy don't we go for another?",
    "10501020_TextContext": "That's... That's not what I meant! I said, “friend.”",
    "14601007_TextContext": "My home in Star Street is only a few blocks away from the bay. If you're game, I'd be happy to take you to enjoy the sights.",
    "14605016_TextContext": "I've just been home a day, haven't I?",
    "10501004_TextContext": "I'm going to tell you something you're probably already aware of.",
    "14603005_TextContext": "I read the forecast carefully. There should have been stars out tonight.",
    "9820007_TextContext": "I'm Celestia. I work as a medic of Urbino. This is my dorm in the Astral Sanctuary.",
    "10501002_TextContext": "Audrey Grove, current head of the Grove Corporation. A pleasure to meet you.",
    "10501014_TextContext": "I'm a navigator, not a businessperson...",
    "9601008_TextContext": "What happened to me?",
    "15105026_TextContext": "When I lost my memory, everything around me felt alien.\nBut this experience taught me that what matters most isn't glory, fame, or fortune but rather the true purity of feeling.",
    "9820011_TextContext": "I took a look at your ID, and it turned out you were my Navigator. Such serendipity.",
    "15101001_TextContext": "As I thought, I do believe you have won!",
    "14603028_TextContext": "My... fortune?",
    "14603015_TextContext": "My light and warmth - I've got plenty to spare for Celestia!",
    "10501028_TextContext": "I was quite sincere with you!",
    "15101023_TextContext": "I believe Strinova must uphold law and order for its citizens to enjoy peaceful, happy lives.",
    "15101022_TextContext": "What justice means to me?\nThis isn't a question one can answer easily.",
    "15146109_TextContext": "I love this world. There are so many things that make me feel anxious and ill at ease. It could be that nothing I do will change anything... But we must press on. Always.",
    "15105004_TextContext": "I understand you must be very unhappy about it... That's why, in the next battle, you're gonna have to get them back with me!",
    "15146115_TextContext": "I've been waiting for you. Thanks for coming.",
    "14602010_TextContext": "It tasted pretty good to me.",
    "14602031_TextContext": "I think it's definitely a taste that everyone should try!",
    "15146117_TextContext": "Nothing I've done until this point has received the least amount of recognition from my mother... Perhaps she feels that I should have walked the same path as her. Do you think I was wrong?",
    "9820023_TextContext": "I still don't really get what it means to be a Navigator...",
    "15101103_TextContext": "The latest episode of the show I've been watching is about to air. I have to finish my meal quickly and go watch it!",
    "14602005_TextContext": "I figured I'd make some jam to give away.",
    "10501009_TextContext": "What does all this have to do with me?",
    "9820018_TextContext": "That's why I took the liberty of tracking you down. I need you to help capture my memories.",
    "14604051_TextContext": "Thanks to you, I've picked out some great gifts!",
    "15105006_TextContext": "Take it. It's a gift.\nDoing nothing would hardly be an act of gratitude...\nIn any case, I just felt like giving you a little praise.",
    "15105105_TextContext": "They say similarity in your taste in tea indicates similarity in many other areas as well.",
    "9604006_TextContext": "From now on, you may encounter more people and challenges.",
    "9820025_TextContext": "Alright. I'm off to the Departure Zone. There's a P.U.S rescue mission that I'm needed for.",
    "9820030_TextContext": "Now, then, you're free to explore Strinova.",
    "9602005_TextContext": "Approaching Anchor Point: Area 88 P.U.S Rescue Mission.",
    "15146107_TextContext": "Don't worry, I don't usually travel armed.\nBut something tells you're worried about something...",
    "14605017_TextContext": "It's been three days since you've left your dorm!",
    "14603004_TextContext": "Aren't the stars of Strian artificial?",
    "14601006_TextContext": "Strian seems pleasant. Green trees, the seaside, and idyllic farms. It's a great place to relax.",
    "14603006_TextContext": "Strian was built to simulate a real world. That's why it follows the natural laws of Earth.",
    "9601001_TextContext": "Countless times...",
    "14604048_TextContext": "It ticks the “dog” and “pyramid” boxes, and the design is pretty avant-garde!",
    "15105010_TextContext": "Since you've expressed your admiration with such sincerity, allow me to accept your present. After all, that is not impermissible... Hmph. Stop overthinking it!",
    "14603024_TextContext": "Tonight's atmosphere should be a solemn one. But, you being here with me...",
    "15105025_TextContext": "Do you understand? I'm not one for changing my mind easily.",
    "9820009_TextContext": "That's what the Astral Sanctuary does. We provide treatment to Strinovians in need.",
